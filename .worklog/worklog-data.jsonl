There is no first-class way to request recommendations tailored for a specific agent persona (e.g., map, patch, probe), which reduces precision when agents are invoked directly or when a producer needs agent-aware suggestions.\n\n- Users\n  - Primary: agent runtimes and agent operators invoking waif next for a named agent (e.g., map, patch).\n  - Secondary: Producers/PMs who want a deterministic way to ask \"what should this agent work on next?\"\n\n- Success criteria\n  1. CLI: Add --agent <name> to waif next such that:\n     - When called with --agent <name>, waif next filters candidate issues by assignee === <name> and uses the existing waif selection heuristics only on that filtered set.\n     - If one or more issues are assigned to <name>, waif next returns the selected assigned issue (human one-row table annotated with agent and short rationale; --json returns the issue object augmented with a waif metadata key as before).\n     - If zero issues are assigned to <name>, waif next prints a clear message: \"No assigned issues for <name>\" and exits with a non-error status (and --json returns an object noting no_assigned: true).\n     - Behavior is deterministic for a given bd state and input (same inputs + unchanged bd state -> same result).\n  2. Tests & docs: Unit/integration tests covering the new flag, the assigned-filtering behavior, and the \"no assigned issues\" response; CLI docs (README and docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md) updated with examples.\n  3. Backwards compatibility: Default waif next behavior (no --agent) remains unchanged.\n\n- Heuristics (applied order -- conservative, explainable)\n  1. Primary filter: assignee === <agent> (only consider assigned issues).\n  2. If assigned issues exist: apply the existing waif heuristics (priority, blockers, issue_type, recent activity) to pick the best assigned issue.\n  3. If no assigned issues exist: do not fall back to label mapping -- report \"No assigned issues for <agent>\".\n\n- Constraints\n  - Keep heuristics conservative and explainable (no heavy ML or opaque scoring). Use repo-available signals only (beads metadata, labels, assignee, recent comments).\n  - Respect ignore boundaries and agent safety rules (no secret/excluded-file exposure).\n  - Do not change existing default behavior unless --agent is used.\n  - Implementation should be testable without modifying remote Beads state.\n\n- Risks & assumptions (short bullets)\n  - Risks:\n    - Misattribution: assignees may be out-of-date or not reflect agent capability, causing false negatives.\n    - Agent idle state: many agents may have no assigned tasks at any given time; the CLI must clearly indicate that state.\n  - Assumptions:\n    - Beads metadata (assignee) is the primary, accepted signal for agent targeting for this phase.\n    - Label->agent mapping and any fallback heuristics will be designed and implemented later once conventions are agreed.\n\n- Existing state (relevant artifacts found)\n  - README.md (waif next description)\n  - src/commands/next.ts (current implementation surface for waif next)\n  - docs/dev/prd/TUI_PRD.md (references waif next / CLI interactions)\n  - .opencode/command/prd.md (PRD authoring command template / interview rules)\n  - .beads/issues.jsonl (existing beads; related issues exist for waif next enhancements)\n  - Existing related beads: wf-3ur.1 (add -n), wf-4y2 (clipboard behavior), wf-64m (cross-command UX)\n\n- Likely duplicates / related docs (files I read)\n  - README.md -- CLI overview & waif next description\n  - src/commands/next.ts -- implementation referenced for changes\n  - docs/dev/prd/TUI_PRD.md -- TUI PRD that references waif next workflows\n  - .opencode/command/prd.md -- PRD authoring spec (process conventions)\n  - .beads/issues.jsonl -- beads DB (I scanned for related issues)\n\n- Related issues (Beads ids)\n  - wf-3ur.1 -- \"Add --number/-n option to 'waif next'\"\n  - wf-4y2 -- \"waif next copies recommended issue ID to clipboard\"\n  - wf-64m -- \"CLI: when 'waif in-progress' finds no in_progress items, inform user and run 'waif next'\"\n  - wf-3ur.2 -- \"Add workflow stage tracking to WAIF CLI: Intake brief\"\n\n- Recommended next step\n  - UPDATE PRD at: docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md (seed or update the CLI PRD with the agent-aware waif next spec and acceptance criteria above).

Operators discovering `waif ooda` need a validated sample `.waif/ooda-scheduler.yaml` with at least one practical example job (e.g., `daily-health`) and clear documentation so they can run the scheduler locally without crafting config from scratch.\n\nUsers\n\n- Primary: Local operators / developers who run `waif ooda` interactively (tmux panes, developer laptops)\n\nSuccess criteria\n\n1) A default `.waif/ooda-scheduler.yaml` file exists in the repo root (or repo-suggested location) and validates against `src/lib/schemas/ooda-scheduler.schema.json`.\n2) Example job(s) included (e.g., `daily-health`, `hello-5s` fixture) and linked from docs/commands/ooda.md and docs/usage/ooda.md so operators can copy/use it easily.\n\nConstraints\n\n- Follow the existing schema: `src/lib/schemas/ooda-scheduler.schema.json` must validate the example config.\n- Keep the example config operator-friendly (no secrets, simple commands, short timeouts for local testing).\n- Respect repository conventions: place ephemeral examples under tests/fixtures when intended for tests; production-like default config should be `.waif/ooda-scheduler.yaml` in repo root or suggested path in docs.\n- Do not change the existing `ooda` command behavior or tests beyond adding example files and docs references.\n\nExisting state\n\n- `waif ooda` CLI (scheduler + run-job) is implemented in `src/commands/ooda.ts` and documented in `docs/commands/ooda.md` and `docs/usage/ooda.md`.\n- There are existing fixtures and tests (e.g., tests/fixtures/ooda.hello-5s.yaml, tests/fixtures/ooda.valid.yaml) and example PRD `docs/dev/prd-ooda-loop.md` describing the canonical OODA scheduler.\n\nDesired change\n\n- Add a default example file at `.waif/ooda-scheduler.yaml` with: 1–3 sample jobs (including `daily-health`), validated against the schema, short timeouts and retention settings suitable for local dev; include comments and usage notes.\n- Add a short example snippet and pointer in `docs/commands/ooda.md` and `docs/usage/ooda.md` linking to the file and showing `waif ooda schedule run <job>` and `waif ooda run-job` usage.\n- Optionally add a test fixture (e.g., tests/fixtures/ooda.default.yaml) or link existing hello-5s fixture if it already meets requirements.\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs\n\n- docs/usage/ooda.md — user-facing OODA usage and examples\n- docs/commands/ooda.md — CLI usage and job examples\n- docs/dev/prd-ooda-loop.md — PRD for Cron-style OODA Scheduler (existing planning artifact)\n- docs/operational/ooda-ci.md — CI validation and smoke testing notes\n- tests/fixtures/ooda.hello-5s.yaml — existing fixture used as an example\n- src/lib/schemas/ooda-scheduler.schema.json — JSON Schema to validate the scheduler config\n- src/commands/ooda.ts — CLI implementation to ensure examples align with flags/behavior\n\nRelated issues (Beads ids)\n\n- wf-cvz — (epic) ooda command / monitor: possible parent for broader OODA work\n- wf-bkt — (feature, closed) run-job subcommand + job runner (run-job landed)\n- wf-4cv — (chore) docs: ooda scheduler command documentation (docs already added/updated)\n- wf-633 — (chore) docs: update ooda docs for run-job CLI and deprecate --once/--events\n- wf-4bx — (task) CLI integration hangs for ooda --once (investigation may be relevant)\n\nRecommended next step\n\nUPDATE PRD at: docs/dev/prd-ooda-loop.md — incorporate the addition of the default `.waif/ooda-scheduler.yaml` example and the small docs edits as the next, scoped implementation step. If you prefer a standalone PRD, we can create: `docs/prd/create_default_ooda_schedule_PRD.md` instead.\n\nImmediate next tasks (suggested):\n\n- Add `.waif/ooda-scheduler.yaml` to the repo root (example config with 1–3 jobs, comments, short timeouts, and retention settings).\n- Add `tests/fixtures/ooda.default.yaml` mapping to the example with short intervals suitable for CI.\n- Update `docs/commands/ooda.md` and `docs/usage/ooda.md` with a pointer and a short example showing `waif ooda schedule run <job>` and `waif ooda run-job --config .waif/ooda-scheduler.yaml --job <id>`.\n- Open a PR with the new files and link this bead; include tests that validate the config against `src/lib/schemas/ooda-scheduler.schema.json`.\n- If this work is part of a broader epic, create the bead as a child/sub-issue under the identified parent (e.g., wf-cvz).\n\n\nNotes / open questions (need your confirmation)\n\n- Confirm preferred location for the default file: repo root `.waif/ooda-scheduler.yaml` (recommended) or docs/fixtures/ or another path?\n- Should we add a new tests fixture `tests/fixtures/ooda.default.yaml` for CI, or reuse `tests/fixtures/ooda.hello-5s.yaml`?\n- Are there any required example jobs beyond a simple `daily-health` or `hello-5s` that you want included?\n\n\n---\n\nThis draft will be used to create the Beads issue description if you approve; tell me any edits and I will incorporate them before proceeding to the five review stages.\n\n\nNotes\nPR #120 merged; implementation landed on main.

Currently decomposition is ad-hoc: deliverables lack consistent acceptance tests, dependencies/blockers are often undocumented, and bead creation is manual—this slows handoffs and increases planning friction.\n\nUsers\n\n- Primary: PMs who author PRDs and produce implementation plans.\n- Secondary: Engineers and Tech Leads who pick work from beads and need clear acceptance criteria; automation that consumes bead graphs.\n\nSuccess criteria\n\nInvoking the plan command with a seed Beads issue produces a child epic (under the supplied issue) and a hierarchy of child beads that together represent the implementation plan. Done test: running `/plan bd-123` where `bd-123` is the seed issue creates a child epic under `bd-123` and at least three child beads; every created bead includes `title`, `short description`, `acceptance criteria`, and `linked PRD path`. Re-running the same command does not create duplicates (idempotence).\n\nConstraints\n\n- Must preserve existing Beads workflows and not overwrite unrelated beads. The command must be idempotent and conservative about changes. It must run as the invoking user (respect BD_ACTOR) and not auto-change assignees without explicit flags.\n- Must integrate with existing OpenCode command conventions in `.opencode/command/` and not break `/prd` or `/intake` behavior.\n\nExisting state\n\n- OpenCode command templates: `.opencode/command/prd.md`, `.opencode/command/intake.md` exist and provide interview templates.\n- Related PRDs and docs: `docs/dev/context_pack_PRD.md`, `docs/dev/opencode_integration_PRD.md`, `docs/Workflow.md`.\n- Related Beads: `wf-70j.4` (PM skill: generate bead hierarchy), `wf-70j.3` (PRD authoring/linking), `wf-70j.2` (scripted intake).\n\nDesired change (what to deliver)\n\n- Implement an OpenCode command `.opencode/command/plan.md` (user-facing spec) that:\n  - Is invoked by Beads issue id: `/plan bd-123` (the command reads the seed issue `bd-123` for context and PRD links).\n  - Defaults to auto-create: the command creates beads under the provided seed issue without requiring an explicit `--auto-create` flag.\n  - Supports an optional `--propose-only` mode to emit `plan.md` and `plan.json` without modifying the Beads DB.\n  - Produces two artifacts on propose-only: `plan.md` (human summary) and `plan.json` (machine bundle compatible with `bd create --file`).\n  - When creating beads, populates each bead with the required fields and annotates created beads with `auto-created-by: wf-5e2` and `Linked PRD: <path>` (the PRD link should be taken from the seed issue body or metadata).\n  - Ensures idempotence by matching existing beads using canonical title + linked PRD path before creating new beads.\n  - Emits a creation log `./.opencode/plan_<timestamp>.json` listing created bead IDs and titles.\n\nRequired fields for every bead\n\n- `title` (short)\n- `short description` (one-line goal)\n- `acceptance criteria` (clear, testable done-test)\n- `linked PRD path` (path to PRD source — taken from the seed issue)\n- `parent` (the provided seed issue becomes the parent; created epic is a child of the seed)\n- `children` (if any)\n- `blockers` (explicit dependency ids, if applicable)\n\nBehavioral rules and edge cases\n\n- Idempotence algorithm: canonicalize candidate titles (lowercase, trim, collapse spaces, strip punctuation) and match against open beads where `linked PRD path` equals the PRD; update existing bead if matched, otherwise create.\n- Auto-create threshold: if decomposition yields more than 25 beads, pause and require explicit PM confirmation before mass-creation (fail-safe threshold configurable).\n- Conflicts: if a matched bead has a different parent or semantics, surface a conflict and pause for PM decision (re-parent vs create new bead).\n- Permissions: respect BD_ACTOR and repo ACLs; never change assignees without `--assign` or explicit approval.\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs\n\n- `.opencode/command/prd.md`\n- `.opencode/command/intake.md`\n- `docs/dev/context_pack_PRD.md`\n- `docs/dev/opencode_integration_PRD.md`\n- `docs/Workflow.md`\n\nRelated Beads\n\n- `wf-70j.4` — PM skill: generate bead hierarchy (plan) with PRD traceability (parent)\n- `wf-70j.3` — PRD authoring + idempotent PRD linking\n- `wf-70j.2` — scripted interview + intake normalization\n\nClarifying questions (to finalize the PRD)\n\n1.

Should wf-ba2 keep an explicit dependency edge to wf-ca1 now that wf-ca1 is closed, or should the dependency be removed for clarity?\n  2. Do we want a dedicated issue (or epic) for ongoing Beads workflow evolution, separate from the initial evaluation?\n  3. Should the doc cross-references continue pointing at wf-ca1, or be updated to reference wf-dt1 (or another successor) instead?\n\n- Proposed next step:\n  - UPDATE PRD at: `docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md` (only if we want to change cross-references away from wf-ca1)\n  - Recommended next command: `/prd docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md wf-ca1`\n","id":"wf-1tfz","issueType":"feature","parentId":null,"priority":"medium","stage":"","status":"completed","tags":["Chore"],"title":"Beads evaluation tasks: Intake brief","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T08:33:07.138Z"},"type":"workitem"}

{"data":{"assignee":"","createdAt":"2025-12-24T23:32:38.599Z","createdBy":"","deleteReason":"","deletedBy":"","description":"Beads DB compaction\n\nSummary\n\nImplement a Beads (bd) feature that supports safe, configurable database compaction workflows based on the recommendations and example scripts from the upstream beads examples (https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/tree/main/examples/compaction). The feature should provide both interactive and fully-automated workflows, support tiered compaction levels, thresholds to avoid low-value runs, and clear observability (logs, stats, cost estimates).\n\nMotivation\n\nCompact sqlite-backed beads DBs periodically to reclaim space, reduce query costs/latency, and keep the JSONL/DB authoritative state tidy for long-running repositories. The upstream examples include workflow.sh (interactive), cron-compact.sh (cron automation) and auto-compact.sh (thresholded automation). Re-implement and integrate these recommendations into this project so teams can run safe compaction as part of maintenance, CI, or scheduled jobs.\n\nScope / Proposed features\n\n- Command surface: provide a 'bd compact' command (or extend existing compact support) with subcommands/modes:\n  - preview / dry-run: list candidate objects and show estimated reclaimable size and issue counts without changing DB\n  - run / execute: perform compaction, with tier option (tier 1 = safe/light, tier 2 = aggressive/deep)\n  - stats: print post-compact statistics and costs (issues compacted, bytes reclaimed, estimated $ cost)\n\n- Automation scripts: add example scripts (interactive workflow.sh, cron-compact.sh, auto-compact.sh) to examples/ or docs/ demonstrating safe usage patterns. These scripts should follow upstream recommendations:\n  - cron-compact: pulls latest changes, runs compact, logs output (BD_LOG_FILE), auto-commits and pushes when compact modifies repo (opt-in)\n  - auto-compact: thresholded runs (only compact when >= N eligible items), supports --tier and --dry-run\n  - workflow.sh: interactive confirmations and preview before committing\n\n- Configuration & env vars:\n  - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: only required if using any AI preview helpers from upstream examples (optional)\n  - BD_REPO_PATH: repo path for cron/script usage\n  - BD_LOG_FILE: where to write compaction logs\n  - CLI flags: --tier, --threshold, --dry-run, --yes/--confirm to bypass prompts, --log-file\n\n- Safety & defaults:\n  - Default to dry-run unless explicit --yes/--commit flag is provided\n  - Provide preview output and require explicit confirmation for any auto-commit/push\n  - Provide idempotent behavior and clear revert guidance in runbook\n\n- Tiering & thresholds:\n  - Tier 1: Quick compacting of easy candidates; low-risk, suitable for CI/auto mode\n  - Tier 2: Ultra-compression / deep compaction; higher risk/time, suitable for scheduled maintenance\n  - Thresholds to avoid noisy runs (e.g., only run if >= 50 eligible items by default)\n\n- Observability / cost monitoring:\n  - bd compact --stats to show counts, bytes reclaimed, and cost estimate\n  - Log file output and exit codes for CI/crontab\n\n- Testing & docs:\n  - Provide manual test instructions (how to run dry-run, how to run cron-compact.sh locally)\n  - Add runbook to history/ (or docs/ if intended to be permanent) with recommended schedules by project size (small/medium/large/high-velocity)\n\nOut of scope\n\n- Changes to underlying beads DB schema or the beads core sqlite engine other than invoking existing compact/rewrite mechanisms.\n\nReferences\n\n- Upstream examples: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/tree/main/examples/compaction\n\nRecommended owners\n\n- Owner (implementation): patch or a maintainer familiar with bd internals\n- Map (PM) to coordinate documentation, acceptance testing and rollout\n\n\n\nAcceptance Criteria\n1) Ability to run non-destructive dry-run compaction and produce a preview report. 2) Provide automated compacting scripts for cron/CI (tiered: tier1 quick, tier2 deep) with threshold configuration. 3) Safe default behavior: dry-run and require explicit opt-in for auto-commit/push. 4) Export compact stats via 'bd compact --stats' and log output to configurable file. 5) Docs and runbook added to docs/ or history/ with testing steps.

Currently we need to use the bd CLI to search; this feature should be exposed in a convenient way as a waif command.\n\nUsers\nPrimary: human producer operating the waif CLI. No secondary stakeholders; agents continue to use bd directly.\n\nSuccess criteria\nProvide a waif command that searches Beads issues by default across title and description, with optional switches to expand search to notes/comments and linked documents. Done when search results are accurate, fast enough for interactive use, and accessible via CLI flags.\n\nConstraints\nNo deadlines or special constraints noted. Must not disrupt existing bd workflows; should work in current environments.\n\nExisting state\nCurrently search requires using bd CLI directly; no waif-native search command exists.\n\nDesired change\nExpose a waif CLI command that wraps search logic with progressive scope flags (default title+description, optional notes/comments, optional linked docs).\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs\n- docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md\n\nRelated issues\n- None\n\nClarifying questions\n1. Should results include metadata like status, priority, and blockers to help triage?\n2. Are fuzzy/partial matches required or should search stay exact substring/regex?\n3. How should linked document search work—do we index docs on demand or rely on existing references?\n4. Should the command support JSON output for scripting?\n5. Are there privacy/visibility limits (e.g., ignore certain labels or private notes)?\n\nProposed next step\nNEW PRD at: docs/dev/beads_search_command_PRD.md\nRecommended next command: /prd docs/dev/beads_search_command_PRD.md <issue-id>\n\nNotes\nIntake brief captured via interview; related docs searched (docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md).

Currently decomposition is ad-hoc: deliverables lack consistent acceptance tests, dependencies/blockers are often undocumented, and bead creation is manual—this slows handoffs and increases planning friction.\n\nUsers\n\n- Primary: PMs who author PRDs and produce implementation plans.\n- Secondary: Engineers and Tech Leads who pick work from beads and need clear acceptance criteria; automation that consumes bead graphs.\n\nSuccess criteria\n\nInvoking the plan command with a seed Beads issue produces a child epic (under the supplied issue) and a hierarchy of child beads that together represent the implementation plan. Done test: running `/plan bd-123` where `bd-123` is the seed issue creates a child epic under `bd-123` and at least three child beads; every created bead includes `title`, `short description`, `acceptance criteria`, and `linked PRD path`. Re-running the same command does not create duplicates (idempotence).\n\nConstraints\n\n- Must preserve existing Beads workflows and not overwrite unrelated beads. The command must be idempotent and conservative about changes. It must run as the invoking user (respect BD_ACTOR) and not auto-change assignees without explicit flags.\n- Must integrate with existing OpenCode command conventions in `.opencode/command/` and not break `/prd` or `/intake` behavior.\n\nExisting state\n\n- OpenCode command templates: `.opencode/command/prd.md`, `.opencode/command/intake.md` exist and provide interview templates.\n- Related PRDs and docs: `docs/dev/context_pack_PRD.md`, `docs/dev/opencode_integration_PRD.md`, `docs/Workflow.md`.\n- Related Beads: `wf-70j.4` (PM skill: generate bead hierarchy), `wf-70j.3` (PRD authoring/linking), `wf-70j.2` (scripted intake).\n\nDesired change (what to deliver)\n\n- Implement an OpenCode command `.opencode/command/plan.md` (user-facing spec) that:\n  - Is invoked by Beads issue id: `/plan bd-123` (the command reads the seed issue `bd-123` for context and PRD links).\n  - Defaults to auto-create: the command creates beads under the provided seed issue without requiring an explicit `--auto-create` flag.\n  - Supports an optional `--propose-only` mode to emit `plan.md` and `plan.json` without modifying the Beads DB.\n  - Produces two artifacts on propose-only: `plan.md` (human summary) and `plan.json` (machine bundle compatible with `bd create --file`).\n  - When creating beads, populates each bead with the required fields and annotates created beads with `auto-created-by: wf-5e2` and `Linked PRD: <path>` (the PRD link should be taken from the seed issue body or metadata).\n  - Ensures idempotence by matching existing beads using canonical title + linked PRD path before creating new beads.\n  - Emits a creation log `./.opencode/plan_<timestamp>.json` listing created bead IDs and titles.\n\nRequired fields for every bead\n\n- `title` (short)\n- `short description` (one-line goal)\n- `acceptance criteria` (clear, testable done-test)\n- `linked PRD path` (path to PRD source — taken from the seed issue)\n- `parent` (the provided seed issue becomes the parent; created epic is a child of the seed)\n- `children` (if any)\n- `blockers` (explicit dependency ids, if applicable)\n\nBehavioral rules and edge cases\n\n- Idempotence algorithm: canonicalize candidate titles (lowercase, trim, collapse spaces, strip punctuation) and match against open beads where `linked PRD path` equals the PRD; update existing bead if matched, otherwise create.\n- Auto-create threshold: if decomposition yields more than 25 beads, pause and require explicit PM confirmation before mass-creation (fail-safe threshold configurable).\n- Conflicts: if a matched bead has a different parent or semantics, surface a conflict and pause for PM decision (re-parent vs create new bead).\n- Permissions: respect BD_ACTOR and repo ACLs; never change assignees without `--assign` or explicit approval.\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs\n\n- `.opencode/command/prd.md`\n- `.opencode/command/intake.md`\n- `docs/dev/context_pack_PRD.md`\n- `docs/dev/opencode_integration_PRD.md`\n- `docs/Workflow.md`\n\nRelated Beads\n\n- `wf-70j.4` — PM skill: generate bead hierarchy (plan) with PRD traceability (parent)\n- `wf-70j.3` — PRD authoring + idempotent PRD linking\n- `wf-70j.2` — scripted interview + intake normalization\n\nClarifying questions (to finalize the PRD)\n\n1.

We need a `waif ask` command that accepts a prompt, sends it to an agent (default `Map`/`PM`), allows optionally prefixing the prompt with an agent name (e.g. `ask patch ...`), and returns the agent's response to the console in Markdown (or `--json`) with no session tracking (one-shot MVP).\n\nUsers\n\nPrimary: producers who need fast, ad-hoc answers in the terminal (PMs/engineers writing prompts).\nSecondary: CLI users and automation that may call `waif ask` from scripts; QA and docs teams who rely on predictable one-shot outputs.\n\nSuccess criteria\n\nMVP success is that a user can run `waif ask \"<prompt>\"` and receive a coherent agent response rendered as Markdown to the console (or machine-readable JSON when `--json` is passed). The UX/implementation goal: ask -> get response (no session), responses are stable Markdown and usable in pipelines.\n\nConstraints\n\nNo timeline or special constraints were specified. No session tracking or state persistence in MVP. Default agent is `Map` (PM); agent override via prefixing the prompt is required. No privacy/security constraints specified by requester.\n\nExisting state\n\n- The CLI contains a PRD/CLI design effort (`docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md`) and PRD-agent wiring work (`wf-ba2.3.6`, `wf-ba2.3.1`) that overlap with PRD generation and OpenCode integration. There is not a dedicated `waif ask` command implemented today.\n\nDesired change\n\nAdd a new `waif ask` CLI command that:\n- Accepts a prompt string or reads from stdin\n- Sends the prompt to a chosen agent (default `Map`/`PM`), allowing an agent name prefix to override\n- Returns the agent's response to stdout rendered as Markdown, or `--json` for machine output\n- Is one-shot only (no session persistence)\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs\n\n- `docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md`\n- `docs/Workflow.md` (intake/PRD workflow)\n- `docs/dev/TUI_PRD.md`\n- `docs/dev/implemented/find_next_PRD.md`\n\nRelated issues\n\n- `wf-ba2.3.1` - Minimal PRD generator (writes Markdown file)\n- `wf-ba2.3.6` - Wire waif prd command to PRD Agent workflow\n- `wf-ba2.3` - PRD Template & Validation (epic)\n- `wf-7m7` - Add waif command to validate implementation plan integrity (related CLI expansion)\n- `wf-soh` - Integrate marked-terminal markdown rendering for all CLI output (rendering pipeline)\n\nClarifying questions\n\n1. Confirm default agent: should `Map` (PM) be the default for `waif ask`?  \n2. Which output modes are required beyond `--json` and rendered Markdown (e.g., raw text, exit codes for partial failures)?  \n3. Should `waif ask` support reading prompts from stdin or files for scripting?  \n4. Is any prompt auditing/logging required (even minimal), or must MVP avoid writing prompts anywhere?  \n5. Are there agent name parsing rules (single token prefix vs multiple-word agent names)?\n\nProposed next step\n\nNEW PRD at: `docs/dev/waif_ask_PRD.md`\nRecommended next command: `/prd docs/dev/waif_ask_PRD.md <issue-id>`\n\nNotes\nOpenCode wiring added; enable with OPENCODE_ENABLED=1 and install OpenCode SDK.

Overview**\nThis module provides a **per‑terminal idle‑time scheduler** for Bash.  \nIt executes a user‑defined task **only when the terminal is idle** (i.e., Bash is displaying the prompt and no interactive foreground process is running).  \n\nExecution occurs at **randomized intervals between 20 and 40 seconds** (30 ± 10 seconds jitter).  \nEach terminal session maintains its own independent schedule and state.\n\n---\n\n## **2. What Is a “Drop‑In Bash Module”?**\nA **drop‑in Bash module** is a standalone `.sh` file designed to be:\n\n- **Self‑contained** (no external dependencies)\n- **Safe to source** from `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or a modular directory such as `~/.bashrc.d/`\n- **Non‑intrusive** (does not override user settings unless explicitly intended)\n- **Composable** with other modules\n\nA drop‑in module:\n\n- Should not assume global variables unless it defines them  \n- Should not overwrite existing `PROMPT_COMMAND` logic  \n- Must chain cleanly with other prompt hooks  \n- Should be removable simply by deleting the file\n\nThis module follows those rules.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Goals**\n- Provide a lightweight, dependency‑free idle scheduler.\n- Ensure tasks run **only when the terminal is idle**.\n- Introduce **random jitter** to avoid synchronized behaviour across terminals.\n- Maintain **per‑terminal isolation**.\n- Be installable simply by dropping a file into a Bash module directory.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Non‑Goals**\n- Not a system‑wide scheduler.\n- Not a precise timing mechanism.\n- Not persistent across sessions.\n- Not intended for long‑running background jobs.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Functional Requirements**\n\n### **5.1 Idle Detection**\n- Scheduler runs only when Bash is about to display the prompt.\n- Implemented via `PROMPT_COMMAND`.\n- Must not run while a foreground process is active.\n\n### **5.2 Randomized Interval**\n- After each execution, the next interval is randomly selected.\n- Range: **20–40 seconds**.\n- Uses Bash’s `$RANDOM`.\n\n### **5.3 Per‑Terminal State**\nEach terminal session maintains:\n\n- `LAST_IDLE_RUN` — timestamp of last execution  \n- `NEXT_IDLE_INTERVAL` — randomized delay until next run  \n\nState is stored in shell variables scoped to the session.\n\n### **5.4 User‑Defined Task**\n- The module exposes a function `idle_task()` for user override.\n- Default implementation prints a timestamp.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Implementation (Drop‑In Module)**\n\nSave as:  \n`~/.bashrc.d/idle-scheduler.sh`  \n(or any sourced location)\n\n```bash\n# --- Idle Scheduler Module (Drop-In) ---\n\n# User-overridable idle task\nidle_task() {\n    echo \"[idle task] Running at $(date)\"\n}\n\n# Random interval bounds (seconds)\nIDLE_MIN=20\nIDLE_MAX=40\n\n# Initialize state if not already set\nLAST_IDLE_RUN=${LAST_IDLE_RUN:-0}\nNEXT_IDLE_INTERVAL=${NEXT_IDLE_INTERVAL:-$(( RANDOM % (IDLE_MAX - IDLE_MIN + 1) + IDLE_MIN ))}\n\n# Preserve existing PROMPT_COMMAND\n__idle_prev_prompt_command=\"$PROMPT_COMMAND\"\n\n# Compose new PROMPT_COMMAND\nPROMPT_COMMAND='\\\n  now=$(date +%s)\\\n\\\n  if (( now - LAST_IDLE_RUN >= NEXT_IDLE_INTERVAL )); then\\\n      idle_task\\\n      LAST_IDLE_RUN=$now\\\n      NEXT_IDLE_INTERVAL=$(( RANDOM % (IDLE_MAX - IDLE_MIN + 1) + IDLE_MIN ))\\\n  fi\\\n\\\n  # Chain previous PROMPT_COMMAND if it exists\\\n  if [[ -n \"$__idle_prev_prompt_command\" ]]; then\\\n      eval \"$__idle_prev_prompt_command\"\\\n  fi\\\n'\n```\n\n---\n\n## **7. Behaviour Examples**\n\n### **7.1 Idle Terminal**\n- User presses Enter repeatedly  \n- Scheduler fires at random intervals  \n- Output appears between prompts\n\n### **7.2 Busy Terminal**\n- User runs `vim`, `top`, `ssh`, etc.  \n- Scheduler does **not** run  \n- Execution resumes when prompt returns\n\n### **7.3 Multiple Terminals**\n- Each terminal has its own independent timer  \n- Random jitter prevents synchronized execution\n\n---\n\n## **8. Extensibility**\n\n### **8.1 Optional Enhancements**\n- Only run when last command succeeded  \n- tmux‑mode awareness  \n- Subshell suppression  \n- Logging hooks  \n- Integration with agent‑based workflows (beads, waif, etc.)\n\n### **8.2 Future Extensions**\n- Pluggable idle‑task registry  \n- Per‑project idle hooks  \n- Adaptive intervals based on load or context  \n\n---\n\n## **9. Risks & Mitigations**\n\n| Risk | Mitigation |\n|------|------------|\n| Excessive output | Override `idle_task` to silence or redirect |\n| PROMPT_COMMAND conflicts | Module chains safely with existing logic |\n| Too frequent execution | Increase `IDLE_MIN` and `IDLE_MAX` |\n| Non‑interactive shells | Guard with `[[ $- == *i* ]]` if needed |\n\n---\n\n## **10. Summary**\nThis drop‑in Bash module provides a clean, modular, and dependency‑free way to run tasks during terminal idle time with randomized intervals. It integrates safely with existing shell configurations and supports per‑terminal isolation, making it ideal for lightweight automation, agent loops, and background checks.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also generate:\n\n- a **module loader** for `.bashrc.d/`  \n- a **waif‑style PRD version**  \n- a **beads node spec**  \n- or a **tmux‑aware variant**\n\nJust tell me the direction you want to take it.\n\n\nNotes\nDocumented that the tmux workflow auto-loads the idle scheduler for the PM pane with idle_task(){ clear; waif in-progress; }.","id":"wf-6pe","issueType":"feature","parentId":null,"priority":"high","stage":"","status":"completed","tags":["feature"],"title":"Idle Scheduler: per-terminal idle-time scheduler (drop-in Bash module)","updatedAt":"2025-12-21T04:33:27.127Z"},"type":"workitem"}

The `waif` CLI could provide a thin convenience wrapper that launches an appropriately-configured OpenCode session and immediately issues `/intake`, saving a manual step and reducing friction for producers and maintainers.\n\nUsers\n- Primary: PMs / producers who author intake briefs and want a fast, consistent way to start the interview.\n- Secondary: Developers and agents who run local workflows and prefer a single `waif` command to start intake sessions.\n\nSuccess criteria\n- Running `waif intake` launches an OpenCode session pre-configured for this repo and issues the `/intake` command into the session so the user immediately sees the interactive intake interview.\n- The command returns success if OpenCode starts and the `/intake` command was issued; it must not attempt to complete the interview non-interactively. (Manual interview continues inside the OpenCode session.)\n- The command must not create or modify beads automatically.\n\nConstraints\n- Must be a thin wrapper only: do not change `/intake` behavior, do not auto-create beads or PRDs, do not alter repo files.\n- Must respect existing `.opencode` configuration and environment variables (e.g., `OPENCODE_*`) so it does not break other OpenCode commands or workflows.\n- Must work on dev machines where `opencode` is available; if not present, print a clear error message with instructions.\n\nExisting state\n- `.opencode/command/intake.md` contains the OpenCode command template and interview questions.\n- `README.md` and `src/lib/opencode.ts` show existing OpenCode integration and CLI usage patterns.\n- There are multiple Beads issues concerning intake/PRD wiring (see Related issues below).\n\nDesired change\n- Add a `waif intake` CLI subcommand that:\n  - Ensures the local OpenCode environment is configured for this repo (uses `.opencode/` config),\n  - Starts an OpenCode session (interactive) and immediately sends `/intake` into it,\n  - Exits after launching the session (the interview runs interactively inside the session),\n  - Emits a helpful message/next-steps if `opencode` is not installed or fails to start.\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs (file paths)\n- `.opencode/command/intake.md`\n- `.opencode/command/prd.md`\n- `README.md`\n- `docs/Workflow.md`\n\nRelated issues (Beads ids)\n- wf-70j.2 — PM skill: scripted interview + intake normalization (reuse /intake)\n- wf-70j.1 — PM skill: define workflow composition with /intake and /prd\n- wf-v0m — Delegate command to pass work to another agent: Intake brief\n- wf-70j.6 — PM skill: command surface wiring (/intake, /prd, /assign-propose)\n- wf-32r — Beads search command: Intake brief\n- wf-3ur.2 — Add workflow stage tracking to WAIF CLI: Intake brief\n\nClarifying questions\n1. Parent bead selected: `wf-70j.2` (confirmed by requestor).\n2. No extra OpenCode args to auto-pass — default behavior only.\n3. Command will be interactive only and must not auto-create beads.\n\nProposed next step\n- Implementation: Add `waif intake` subcommand that starts an OpenCode session and issues `/intake`.\n- No standalone PRD required; attach this feature as a child of `wf-70j.2`.\n- Recommended follow-up: small CLI test that asserts `waif intake` exits with success when `opencode` present, and emits a user-facing error when not.","id":"wf-70j.2.1","issueType":"feature","parentId":"wf-70j.2","priority":"low","stage":"","status":"open","tags":[],"title":"waif intake command — convenience wrapper for /intake","updatedAt":"2026-01-02T19:18:13.373Z"},"type":"workitem"}

We need a `waif ask` command that accepts a prompt, sends it to an agent (default `Map`/`PM`), allows optionally prefixing the prompt with an agent name (e.g. `ask patch ...`), and returns the agent's response to the console in Markdown (or `--json`) with no session tracking (one-shot MVP).\n\nUsers\n\nPrimary: producers who need fast, ad-hoc answers in the terminal (PMs/engineers writing prompts).\nSecondary: CLI users and automation that may call `waif ask` from scripts; QA and docs teams who rely on predictable one-shot outputs.\n\nSuccess criteria\n\nMVP success is that a user can run `waif ask \"<prompt>\"` and receive a coherent agent response rendered as Markdown to the console (or machine-readable JSON when `--json` is passed). The UX/implementation goal: ask -> get response (no session), responses are stable Markdown and usable in pipelines.\n\nConstraints\n\nNo timeline or special constraints were specified. No session tracking or state persistence in MVP. Default agent is `Map` (PM); agent override via prefixing the prompt is required. No privacy/security constraints specified by requester.\n\nExisting state\n\n- The CLI contains a PRD/CLI design effort (`docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md`) and PRD-agent wiring work (`wf-ba2.3.6`, `wf-ba2.3.1`) that overlap with PRD generation and OpenCode integration. There is not a dedicated `waif ask` command implemented today.\n\nDesired change\n\nAdd a new `waif ask` CLI command that:\n- Accepts a prompt string or reads from stdin\n- Sends the prompt to a chosen agent (default `Map`/`PM`), allowing an agent name prefix to override\n- Returns the agent's response to stdout rendered as Markdown, or `--json` for machine output\n- Is one-shot only (no session persistence)\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs\n\n- `docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md`\n- `docs/Workflow.md` (intake/PRD workflow)\n- `docs/dev/TUI_PRD.md`\n- `docs/dev/implemented/find_next_PRD.md`\n\nRelated issues\n\n- `wf-ba2.3.1` - Minimal PRD generator (writes Markdown file)\n- `wf-ba2.3.6` - Wire waif prd command to PRD Agent workflow\n- `wf-ba2.3` - PRD Template & Validation (epic)\n- `wf-7m7` - Add waif command to validate implementation plan integrity (related CLI expansion)\n- `wf-soh` - Integrate marked-terminal markdown rendering for all CLI output (rendering pipeline)\n\nClarifying questions\n\n1. Confirm default agent: should `Map` (PM) be the default for `waif ask`?  \n2. Which output modes are required beyond `--json` and rendered Markdown (e.g., raw text, exit codes for partial failures)?  \n3. Should `waif ask` support reading prompts from stdin or files for scripting?  \n4. Is any prompt auditing/logging required (even minimal), or must MVP avoid writing prompts anywhere?  \n5. Are there agent name parsing rules (single token prefix vs multiple-word agent names)?\n\nProposed next step\n\nNEW PRD at: `docs/dev/waif_ask_PRD.md`\nRecommended next command: `/prd docs/dev/waif_ask_PRD.md <issue-id>`","id":"wf-7gtp","issueType":"feature","parentId":null,"priority":"medium","stage":"","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"waif ask: one-shot CLI agent query","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T08:33:07.377Z"},"type":"workitem"}

Done test: given a bead id, calling the plugin returns a JSON payload and a sample agent can consume it to start a task; unit tests verify redaction and token-budget summarization.\n\nConstraints\n\n- Must not include ignored or sensitive files; redaction follows  and existing redaction helpers.\n- Compatibility: the change must be additive and not break existing Wrote context pack to /home/rgardler/projects/waif/docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md CLI behavior.\n- Output must be machine-readable (JSON) and size-bounded (support /profile); if the payload exceeds budget, the plugin must summarize and create/update a P0 bead for PM review per existing PRD rules.\n\nExisting state\n\n- CLI command:  (generates/writes ). (src/commands/context.ts:1)\n- Doc scanner:  (scans  and extracts excerpts). (src/lib/contextGenerator.ts:1)\n- Canonical PRD: . (docs/dev/context_pack_PRD.md:1)\n- Generated pack: . (docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md:1)\n- Tests mentioning pack: . (tests/context.command.test.ts:1)\n\nDesired change\n\nUpdate  to add a plugin section specifying:\n- API surface: OpenCode command  plus  CLI wrapper (e.g., ) returning JSON.\n- Selection rules for documents (proximity, explicit links, headings, manual overrides) and scoring.\n- Redaction & token-budget strategy (summarize/shorten and create/update overflow P0 bead).\n- Example payload JSON schema and sample OpenCode caller flow.\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs\n\n-  (update target). (docs/dev/context_pack_PRD.md:1)\n- . (docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md:1)\n-  (CLI entries). (docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md:1)\n- . (src/commands/context.ts:1)\n- . (src/lib/contextGenerator.ts:1)\n- .

Proceed? (recommended)\n2) Inputs: allow  (implementer|reviewer) and  — confirm accepted parameters.\n3) Redaction: is -based redaction sufficient or add explicit deny-list (e.g., )?\n\nProposed next step\n\n- UPDATE PRD at: \n- Recommended next command: \n\n,description:Update intake brief to final draft","id":"wf-8bta","issueType":"feature","parentId":null,"priority":"medium","stage":"","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Context from plugin","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T08:33:07.340Z"},"type":"workitem"}

This reduces noise while preserving a first-pass automated review. Ship (CI/Repo admin) should configure the repo appropriately (either via the official Copilot-for-PRs GitHub App settings or via a minimal GitHub Actions workflow) and validate behaviour.\n\nScope & constraints\n\n- Do NOT change or rely on local uncommitted files in the main repo workspace. Create branches from origin/main for any workflow file changes.\n- Prefer repo-level GitHub App configuration (preferred, least-privilege) over writing a workflow that uses an elevated PAT. If App installation is not possible (organization policy), implement a scoped GitHub Actions workflow that calls Copilot action/API and is triggered only on pull_request types: [opened].\n- Document exact permission grants and secrets / tokens needed. Avoid using tokens with broad org-level permissions.\n\nAcceptance criteria (concrete)\n\n1) When a PR is opened in this repository, Copilot (or the configured automation) posts an automated review/comment summarizing high-level issues (lint/test failures, quick suggestions or review notes) within 10 minutes of PR creation.\n2) When subsequent commits are pushed to the same PR (pull_request:synchronize), the Copilot automation does NOT post new automated reviews/comments. (It may update an existing comment only if you choose that behaviour, but it must not create a new review on synchronize.)\n3) Demonstration: create a short test PR (branch: ci/copilot-pr-check) that triggers the behaviour and capture: PR URL, link to the Copilot review/comment, and timeline showing it ran on PR opened and did not run on a follow-up push.\n4) Documentation: add history/github-copilot-pr.md describing the chosen implementation, configuration steps (App install or workflow file), permissions granted, and how to revert. If a workflow file was added, place it at .github/workflows/copilot-pr-review.yml and include the job trigger definition showing it only runs on pull_request: types: [opened].\n5) Security/audit: list any tokens or secrets used and recommend rotation/least-privilege scope. If an org-admin is required to complete the work, escalate and document the required admin action.\n\nDeliverables (expected)\n\n- Either: GitHub App configured for “Copilot for PRs” with settings changed to only run on PR opened (preferred). OR: Workflow file .github/workflows/copilot-pr-review.yml that triggers only on PR opened and calls the Copilot review action/API.\n- A short test PR (ci/copilot-pr-check) demonstrating the behaviour (opened → Copilot review posted; push new commit → no new review created).\n- Documentation at history/github-copilot-pr.md documenting steps, permissions, and test evidence.\n- A bd comment on this task with commands run, PR URL(s), and verification evidence.\n\nSuggested steps & example commands\n\n(1) Check app availability and install/configure (preferred):\n- Inspect repo Installations: gh api repos/:owner/:repo/installation --jq '.id' (or use org UI)\n- If Copilot for PRs is available as a GitHub App, configure its event subscriptions or settings to only act on pull_request.opened events (consult org admin if needed)\n\n(2) If App install is not possible, create a minimal Actions workflow (example trigger):\n- Create branch: git fetch origin && git checkout -b copilot-pr/setup origin/main\n- Add .github/workflows/copilot-pr-review.yml with:\n  on:\n    pull_request:\n      types: [opened]\n  jobs:\n    copilot_review:\n      runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n      steps:\n        - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        - name: Run Copilot review (choose action or script that calls Copilot)\n          run: |\n            # call copilot review API or action here\n\n(3) Test & validate:\n- gh pr create --title \"test: copilot pr review\" --head copilot-pr/setup --base main\n- Capture PR URL and verify Copilot posted a review shortly after open\n- Push a dummy commit to the PR and confirm no additional automated review is created\n\nPriority & timebox\n\nPriority: 2 (medium). Timebox: initial implementation + test within 2 working days. If App-level permissions or org-admin involvement is required, escalate immediately and post a blocker on the bd issue.\n\nNotes on least-privilege\n\n- Prefer using the GitHub App (Copilot for PRs) which scopes itself via the App installation instead of storing tokens in repo secrets.\n- If using Actions, create a dedicated machine user / token with minimal repo scope and document it.\n\nPlease acknowledge pickup on this bd task and post the first commands you will run. If you need org-admin permissions, escalate immediately and document the required action.\n\n\n\nNotes\n/delegate @ship\n\nDo this now (authoritative handoff)\n\nRationale\n- We need GitHub Copilot to post an automated review only when a PR is first opened, and NOT to create new automated reviews on subsequent PR updates. This reduces noise while preserving a first-pass automated review.\n\nScope (pick ONE approach and implement):\nA) Preferred — GitHub App configuration\n   - If the Copilot-for-PRs GitHub App is installable/configurable for this repo, update its settings so it runs on pull_request:opened only (or equivalent \"Run on PR open\" toggle) and does not run on pull_request:synchronize. Document the exact setting changed and provide evidence (screenshot link or setting dump) in the bd comment.\nB) Fallback — GitHub Actions workflow\n   - Add a minimal workflow at .github/workflows/copilot-pr-review.yml that triggers only on pull_request: types: [opened] and invokes the Copilot review action/API with least-privilege credentials. Document secrets used and their minimal scopes.\n\nAcceptance criteria (must meet to close wf-8re)\n1) On PR open, Copilot posts an automated review/comment within 10 minutes summarizing quick findings.\n2) On subsequent pushes to the same PR (pull_request:synchronize), no new automated Copilot review/comment is created. (Updating an existing comment is acceptable if documented, but do NOT create a new review on synchronize.)\n3) Demonstration: Create test PRs to show behaviour: ci/copilot-pr-check (open → Copilot review posted) and ci/copilot-pr-check-updated (push new commit → no new review). Provide PR URLs and timestamps.\n4) Documentation: add history/github-copilot-pr.md describing chosen approach, commands run, permissions/secrets used, how to revert, and test evidence.\n5) Post a bd comment on wf-8re with exact git/gh commands run, PR URLs, and verification evidence. If org-admin action was required, include the escalation details.\n\nConstraints & notes\n- Do NOT base branches on local uncommitted changes. Always create branches from origin/main.\n- Prefer the App route for least privilege. If App change requires org-admin, escalate immediately and document the requested admin action.\n- If using Actions, use a machine user token with minimal repo scope and document rotation/expiry recommendation.\n\nImmediate steps (exact commands to run now)\n1) Check App availability:\n   - git fetch origin\n   - gh api repos/:owner/:repo/installation --jq '.id' || echo \"No App installation info available\"\n   - If App present, inspect its settings in the GitHub UI and change to run on PR opened only (document the UI path and exact toggles changed).\n2) If App route unavailable, implement workflow:\n   - git fetch origin && git checkout -b copilot-pr/setup origin/main\n   - Create .github/workflows/copilot-pr-review.yml with 'on: pull_request: types: [opened]'\n   - git add .github/workflows/copilot-pr-review.yml && git commit -m \"wf-8re: add Copilot PR-on-open workflow\" && git push -u origin copilot-pr/setup\n   - gh pr create --title \"ci: copilot-pr-check\" --head copilot-pr/setup --base main --body \"Test: Copilot PR-on-open behaviour. References bd#wf-8re\"\n3) Create a short test PR branch to demonstrate behaviour:\n   - git checkout -b ci/copilot-pr-check origin/main && gh pr create --title \"test: copilot pr check\" --head ci/copilot-pr-check --base main\n\nReporting & handoff\n- Post an acknowledgement comment on bd#wf-8re with the exact commands you ran and their outputs (copy-paste). Include PR URLs and evidence (timestamps, screenshots or links) showing Copilot ran on open and not on synchronize.\n- If you need org-admin permissions to change App settings, post a blocker comment on wf-8re and escalate to the Producer with the exact admin steps required.\n\nTimebox\n- Priority: P2. Target initial implementation + demo within 2 working days. Escalate immediately if admin privileges are required.\n\nFiles expected to be created/edited if using Actions route:\n- .github/workflows/copilot-pr-review.yml\n- history/github-copilot-pr.md\n- Branches: copilot-pr/setup and ci/copilot-pr-check\n\nPlease acknowledge pickup on bd#wf-8re and post the first commands you run.

Overview**\nThis module provides a **per‑terminal idle‑time scheduler** for Bash.  \nIt executes a user‑defined task **only when the terminal is idle** (i.e., Bash is displaying the prompt and no interactive foreground process is running).  \n\nExecution occurs at **randomized intervals between 20 and 40 seconds** (30 ± 10 seconds jitter).  \nEach terminal session maintains its own independent schedule and state.\n\n---\n\n## **2. What Is a “Drop‑In Bash Module”?**\nA **drop‑in Bash module** is a standalone `.sh` file designed to be:\n\n- **Self‑contained** (no external dependencies)\n- **Safe to source** from `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or a modular directory such as `~/.bashrc.d/`\n- **Non‑intrusive** (does not override user settings unless explicitly intended)\n- **Composable** with other modules\n\nA drop‑in module:\n\n- Should not assume global variables unless it defines them  \n- Should not overwrite existing `PROMPT_COMMAND` logic  \n- Must chain cleanly with other prompt hooks  \n- Should be removable simply by deleting the file\n\nThis module follows those rules.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Goals**\n- Provide a lightweight, dependency‑free idle scheduler.\n- Ensure tasks run **only when the terminal is idle**.\n- Introduce **random jitter** to avoid synchronized behaviour across terminals.\n- Maintain **per‑terminal isolation**.\n- Be installable simply by dropping a file into a Bash module directory.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Non‑Goals**\n- Not a system‑wide scheduler.\n- Not a precise timing mechanism.\n- Not persistent across sessions.\n- Not intended for long‑running background jobs.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Functional Requirements**\n\n### **5.1 Idle Detection**\n- Scheduler runs only when Bash is about to display the prompt.\n- Implemented via `PROMPT_COMMAND`.\n- Must not run while a foreground process is active.\n\n### **5.2 Randomized Interval**\n- After each execution, the next interval is randomly selected.\n- Range: **20–40 seconds**.\n- Uses Bash’s `$RANDOM`.\n\n### **5.3 Per‑Terminal State**\nEach terminal session maintains:\n\n- `LAST_IDLE_RUN` — timestamp of last execution  \n- `NEXT_IDLE_INTERVAL` — randomized delay until next run  \n\nState is stored in shell variables scoped to the session.\n\n### **5.4 User‑Defined Task**\n- The module exposes a function `idle_task()` for user override.\n- Default implementation prints a timestamp.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Implementation (Drop‑In Module)**\n\nSave as:  \n`~/.bashrc.d/idle-scheduler.sh`  \n(or any sourced location)\n\n```bash\n# --- Idle Scheduler Module (Drop-In) ---\n\n# User-overridable idle task\nidle_task() {\n    echo \"[idle task] Running at $(date)\"\n}\n\n# Random interval bounds (seconds)\nIDLE_MIN=20\nIDLE_MAX=40\n\n# Initialize state if not already set\nLAST_IDLE_RUN=${LAST_IDLE_RUN:-0}\nNEXT_IDLE_INTERVAL=${NEXT_IDLE_INTERVAL:-$(( RANDOM % (IDLE_MAX - IDLE_MIN + 1) + IDLE_MIN ))}\n\n# Preserve existing PROMPT_COMMAND\n__idle_prev_prompt_command=\"$PROMPT_COMMAND\"\n\n# Compose new PROMPT_COMMAND\nPROMPT_COMMAND='\\\n  now=$(date +%s)\\\n\\\n  if (( now - LAST_IDLE_RUN >= NEXT_IDLE_INTERVAL )); then\\\n      idle_task\\\n      LAST_IDLE_RUN=$now\\\n      NEXT_IDLE_INTERVAL=$(( RANDOM % (IDLE_MAX - IDLE_MIN + 1) + IDLE_MIN ))\\\n  fi\\\n\\\n  # Chain previous PROMPT_COMMAND if it exists\\\n  if [[ -n \"$__idle_prev_prompt_command\" ]]; then\\\n      eval \"$__idle_prev_prompt_command\"\\\n  fi\\\n'\n```\n\n---\n\n## **7. Behaviour Examples**\n\n### **7.1 Idle Terminal**\n- User presses Enter repeatedly  \n- Scheduler fires at random intervals  \n- Output appears between prompts\n\n### **7.2 Busy Terminal**\n- User runs `vim`, `top`, `ssh`, etc.  \n- Scheduler does **not** run  \n- Execution resumes when prompt returns\n\n### **7.3 Multiple Terminals**\n- Each terminal has its own independent timer  \n- Random jitter prevents synchronized execution\n\n---\n\n## **8. Extensibility**\n\n### **8.1 Optional Enhancements**\n- Only run when last command succeeded  \n- tmux‑mode awareness  \n- Subshell suppression  \n- Logging hooks  \n- Integration with agent‑based workflows (beads, waif, etc.)\n\n### **8.2 Future Extensions**\n- Pluggable idle‑task registry  \n- Per‑project idle hooks  \n- Adaptive intervals based on load or context  \n\n---\n\n## **9. Risks & Mitigations**\n\n| Risk | Mitigation |\n|------|------------|\n| Excessive output | Override `idle_task` to silence or redirect |\n| PROMPT_COMMAND conflicts | Module chains safely with existing logic |\n| Too frequent execution | Increase `IDLE_MIN` and `IDLE_MAX` |\n| Non‑interactive shells | Guard with `[[ $- == *i* ]]` if needed |\n\n---\n\n## **10. Summary**\nThis drop‑in Bash module provides a clean, modular, and dependency‑free way to run tasks during terminal idle time with randomized intervals. It integrates safely with existing shell configurations and supports per‑terminal isolation, making it ideal for lightweight automation, agent loops, and background checks.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also generate:\n\n- a **module loader** for `.bashrc.d/`  \n- a **waif‑style PRD version**  \n- a **beads node spec**  \n- or a **tmux‑aware variant**\n\nJust tell me the direction you want to take it.\n\n\nNotes\nDocumented that the tmux workflow auto-loads the idle scheduler for the PM pane with idle_task(){ clear; waif in-progress; }.","id":"wf-9gda","issueType":"feature","parentId":null,"priority":"high","stage":"","status":"completed","tags":["feature"],"title":"Idle Scheduler: per-terminal idle-time scheduler (drop-in Bash module)","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T08:33:07.445Z"},"type":"workitem"}

A dedicated waif delegate shortcut accepting a bead id, a short action phrase, and an agent target would provide a concise, auditable, reproducible way to delegate routine tasks to agents.\n\nUsers:\n- Primary: Producer (human) who delegates work.\n- Secondary: agent roles (patch, probe, scribbler, ship) that receive delegations; repo maintainers who review delegated actions.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n- A CLI command \"waif delegate <bd-id> <action> to <agent>\" exists that validates the bead id, records a delegation audit note in the bead, and issues a deterministic waif ask to the target agent with a standard prompt template. Acceptance test: running \"waif delegate wf-123 implement to patch\" results in a beads note on wf-123 containing \"delegated-to:@patch (implement)\" and an entry in the ask log.\n\nConstraints:\n- Timeline: P2 default.\n- Risk tolerance: low for automation performing publishing actions; default behavior is ask-only and requires explicit delegation for push/merge.\n- Compatibility: reuse existing waif ask mechanics and beads audit conventions; do not perform push/merge unless explicitly delegated.\n\nExisting state:\n- waif ask exists (src/commands/ask.ts).\n- Docs reference delegation patterns and recording conventions.\n\nDesired change:\n- Add a CLI subcommand waif delegate that: 1) validates bead id exists and is open; 2) formats a standard delegation prompt; 3) records an idempotent beads note (delegated-to:@<agent> (<action>)); 4) invokes waif ask to send the prompt; 5) prevents risky actions by default and surfaces approvals required.\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs:\n- docs/Workflow.md\n- docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md\n- docs/dev/TUI_PRD.md\n- docs/dev/git_workflow.md\n- docs/.github/permissions_matrix.md\n- .opencode/command/implement.md\n- .opencode/command/intake.md\n\nRelated issues:\n- wf-2ia: PM Delegation Workflow\n- wf-70j: Define the PM process for selecting and assigning work: Intake brief\n- wf-79y.15: Permissions & enforcement matrix for git operations\n\nClarifying questions:\n1) Should waif delegate be a client-side helper that only writes the beads note and composes waif ask, or should it optionally perform push/merge when delegated to an actor (opt-in only)?\n2) What is the canonical prompt template to send to agents? (e.g., \"Please implement <bd-id>: <short action>\").\n3) Which agents (if any) should be allowed push/merge rights by default?\n\nProposed next step:\n- NEW PRD at: docs/dev/delegate_command_PRD.md\n- Recommended command to continue: /prd docs/dev/delegate_command_PRD.md <new-issue-id>","id":"wf-aca4","issueType":"feature","parentId":null,"priority":"medium","stage":"","status":"open","tags":[],"title":"Delegate command to pass work to another agent: Intake brief","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T08:33:07.365Z"},"type":"workitem"}

Minimum required section outline for `docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md` (top-level headings) so the generator stays stable?\n2. How should “~20,000 tokens” be measured (approximate by characters/words, or via a tokenizer implementation)?\n3. P0 issue strategy on overflow: one long-lived issue updated each time vs create a new P0 each time?\n4. Should `waif ctx` enumerate PRDs/specs by scanning `docs/dev/*PRD*.md`, or rely on a curated allowlist?\n5. Should ordering be deterministic (stable sort by path/title) to reduce diff noise?\n\nProposed next step\n- NEW PRD at: docs/dev/context_pack_PRD.md\n- Recommended next command: /prd docs/dev/context_pack_PRD.md wf-ba2.5.4\n\n\nNotes\nPR: https://github.com/SorraTheOrc/waif/pull/88","id":"wf-ba2.5.4","issueType":"feature","parentId":"wf-ba2.5","priority":"medium","stage":"","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Context Pack command (waif ctx): Intake brief","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T01:16:16.999Z"},"type":"workitem"}

It must NOT copy `.beads/` (users should run `beads init` separately to create repository beads).\n\n## Constraints\n- Must NOT copy the repository’s `.beads/` folder.\n- Default behavior on conflicts: abort and explain how to use idempotent runs; do not overwrite silently.\n- Must not require elevated privileges or alter remote state; must be safe on repeated runs.\n- Must be compatible with existing `waif` CLI behavior and tests.\n\n## Existing state\n- `scripts/start-workflow-tmux.sh` (tmux startup script)\n- `config/workflow_agents.yaml` (tmux pane definitions)\n- `docs/dev/opencode_integration_PRD.md` (related setup PRD)\n- `docs/dev/context_pack_PRD.md` (related agent context PRD)\n- `docs/Workflow.md` (workflow guidance)\n\n## Desired change\nAdd a `waif init` CLI command that:\n- Runs `bd init --branch beads-wync --prefix <prefix>` in the target repo before copying files to create the beads sync worktree and avoid copying `.beads/`.\n- Copies the following template files into a target project: the entire `.opencode/` directory, `config/`, `scripts/`, and `docs/dev/`.\n- Do NOT copy `.beads/`.\n- Default conflict policy: abort with an explanation and guidance on idempotent re-runs.\n- Provide `--dry-run`, `--minimal` (only `config/`), and `--full` (config + scripts + `.opencode/` + `docs/dev/`) modes.\n- Optionally provide `--force-backup` for implementers to support backups (PRD will define exact flags).\n- Validate that `./scripts/start-workflow-tmux.sh` exists and is executable; output the command to start the workflow.\n\n## Likely duplicates / related docs\n- `docs/dev/opencode_integration_PRD.md`\n- `docs/dev/context_pack_PRD.md`\n- `docs/Workflow.md`\n- `config/workflow_agents.yaml`\n- `scripts/start-workflow-tmux.sh`\n- `config/waif_pacakges.yaml`\n\n## Related issues (Beads ids)\n- `wf-ba2.3.5` — Per-repo config file (template + lint rules)\n- `wf-jax`, `wf-jax.1` — Context/plugin PRD updates\n- `wf-moa` — Context pack default behavior\n- `wf-ba2.5.4.4` — Overflow handling for context pack\n\n## Clarifying questions\n1. Confirmed default file set: copy `.opencode/`, `config/`, `scripts/`, and `docs/dev/` (do not copy `.beads/`).\n2.

This guarantees the long-lived process in the pane keeps the canonical agent environment (BD_ACTOR/WAIF_AGENT/OPENCODE_AGENT) on its PID so probes (ooda) can reliably detect agent identity via /proc.<newline><newline>Why\\n- Problem: if the agent process daemonizes (forks), the PID visible to tmux may be a short-lived wrapper or shell; the actual agent process may have a different PID or environment, breaking /proc-based detection.\\n- Solution: add a no-daemon/foreground mode to startWork (honor BEADS_NO_DAEMON env or add --no-daemon flag) so the agent process remains the foreground process of the pane.\\n\\nScope (what this issue is NOT)\\n- Not changing production service behavior except when explicitly requested by pane startup scripts or interactive invocation. This is targeted at interactive tmux panes and dev/test runs.\\n\\nDeliverables\\n1) Code: Modify src/commands/startWork.ts to:\\n   - Honor an environment variable (BEADS_NO_DAEMON=1) or accept a flag (e.g., --no-daemon) to run the agent process in foreground (do not fork/daemonize).\\n   - Document behavior in command help and code comments.\\n2) Tests: Unit tests and/or integration tests that validate startWork launches an interactive shell process with environment vars set (mock spawn behavior). Add tests to tests/ to cover both normal and no-daemon behavior.\\n3) Docs: Update docs/Workflow.md (or add small doc) describing the no-daemon convention and when to use it.\\n4) Validation: Manual end-to-end test instructions and checklist (run scripts/start-workflow-tmux.sh then waif ooda --once and confirm mapping).\\n5) Beads cross-links: Link wf-cvz.1 and wf-vaq as related items.\\n\\nImplementation steps (suggested)\\n1) Design RFC (quick note in issue): choose runtime mechanism (env var vs flag). Recommend supporting BEADS_NO_DAEMON env var for minimal changes to startup scripts.\\n2) Code change: in src/commands/startWork.ts, when BEADS_NO_DAEMON=1 or --no-daemon passed, avoid any behavior that would background or exec a separate daemon process; ensure spawnSync/spawn usage preserves foreground process semantics. If the underlying agent runtime has a built-in daemon mode, pass a flag to disable it.\\n3) Tests: Add unit tests mocking child_process spawn/spawnSync to ensure the environment and command-line used when BEADS_NO_DAEMON=1 results in foreground process invocation and that the PID in the pane can be inspected.\\n4) Docs & startup: ensure scripts/start-workflow-tmux.sh sets BEADS_NO_DAEMON=1 when launching panes (already done in recent change) and document the expected behavior.\\n5) Validation: run start-workflow-tmux.sh on a Linux host and check inside a pane: patch and run Agent     | Status | Title                                                                                              \n----------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nmuse      | Free   | Muse (Design)                                                                                      \nmap       | Free   | Map (PM)                                                                                           \nmuse      | Free   | Muse (Design)                                                                                      \npatch     | Free   | Patch (Impl)                                                                                       \nscribbler | Free   | Scribbler (Docs)                                                                                   \npixel     | Free   | Pixel (Art)                                                                                        \nprobe     | Free   | Probe (QA)                                                                                         \nship      | Free   | Ship (DevOps)                                                                                       to verify mapping.\\n6) Rollout: merge change behind a short migration note; this behavior only impacts interactive panes and should be safe for CI or server usage where daemonization may still be desired unless BEADS_NO_DAEMON is set.\\n\\nSuccess criteria\\n- When BEADS_NO_DAEMON=1 (or --no-daemon used),  runs as the foreground process (no immediate background daemonizing) and the PID of the pane process corresponds to the agent process that inherits BD_ACTOR/WAIF_AGENT.\\n- ooda probe maps panes to canonical agent names reliably in manual end-to-end tests.\\n- Tests added and passing locally (npm run build && npm test).\\n\\nOwner suggestion and schedule\\n- Owner: patch (implementation), map (PM) to coordinate and review docs.\\n- ETA: small change — 1-2 days for implementation, tests and PR review.\\n\\nRisks & mitigations\\n- Risk: Some use-cases expect daemonization (e.g., running agents under supervisor/daemon). Mitigation: this change is opt-in via env var or CLI flag — default behavior unchanged.\\n- Risk: Interactive shells or third-party tools may still background themselves. Mitigation: document the limitation; prefer process env detection as primary signal and maintain fallbacks.\\n\\nFollow-ups\\n- After merge, update scripts/start-workflow-tmux.sh and any pane spawners to set BEADS_NO_DAEMON for interactive panes (already changed in branch).\\n- Monitor any user reports about changed behavior and provide a rollback path (remove BEADS_NO_DAEMON export in startup scripts).\\n\n\nNotes\nFollow-up: implement no-daemon/foreground mode for waif startWork per plan.

There is no first-class way to request recommendations tailored for a specific agent persona (e.g., map, patch, probe), which reduces precision when agents are invoked directly or when a producer needs agent-aware suggestions.\n\n- Users\n  - Primary: agent runtimes and agent operators invoking waif next for a named agent (e.g., map, patch).\n  - Secondary: Producers/PMs who want a deterministic way to ask \"what should this agent work on next?\"\n\n- Success criteria\n  1. CLI: Add --agent <name> to waif next such that:\n     - When called with --agent <name>, waif next filters candidate issues by assignee === <name> and uses the existing waif selection heuristics only on that filtered set.\n     - If one or more issues are assigned to <name>, waif next returns the selected assigned issue (human one-row table annotated with agent and short rationale; --json returns the issue object augmented with a waif metadata key as before).\n     - If zero issues are assigned to <name>, waif next prints a clear message: \"No assigned issues for <name>\" and exits with a non-error status (and --json returns an object noting no_assigned: true).\n     - Behavior is deterministic for a given bd state and input (same inputs + unchanged bd state -> same result).\n  2. Tests & docs: Unit/integration tests covering the new flag, the assigned-filtering behavior, and the \"no assigned issues\" response; CLI docs (README and docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md) updated with examples.\n  3. Backwards compatibility: Default waif next behavior (no --agent) remains unchanged.\n\n- Heuristics (applied order -- conservative, explainable)\n  1. Primary filter: assignee === <agent> (only consider assigned issues).\n  2. If assigned issues exist: apply the existing waif heuristics (priority, blockers, issue_type, recent activity) to pick the best assigned issue.\n  3. If no assigned issues exist: do not fall back to label mapping -- report \"No assigned issues for <agent>\".\n\n- Constraints\n  - Keep heuristics conservative and explainable (no heavy ML or opaque scoring). Use repo-available signals only (beads metadata, labels, assignee, recent comments).\n  - Respect ignore boundaries and agent safety rules (no secret/excluded-file exposure).\n  - Do not change existing default behavior unless --agent is used.\n  - Implementation should be testable without modifying remote Beads state.\n\n- Risks & assumptions (short bullets)\n  - Risks:\n    - Misattribution: assignees may be out-of-date or not reflect agent capability, causing false negatives.\n    - Agent idle state: many agents may have no assigned tasks at any given time; the CLI must clearly indicate that state.\n  - Assumptions:\n    - Beads metadata (assignee) is the primary, accepted signal for agent targeting for this phase.\n    - Label->agent mapping and any fallback heuristics will be designed and implemented later once conventions are agreed.\n\n- Existing state (relevant artifacts found)\n  - README.md (waif next description)\n  - src/commands/next.ts (current implementation surface for waif next)\n  - docs/dev/prd/TUI_PRD.md (references waif next / CLI interactions)\n  - .opencode/command/prd.md (PRD authoring command template / interview rules)\n  - .beads/issues.jsonl (existing beads; related issues exist for waif next enhancements)\n  - Existing related beads: wf-3ur.1 (add -n), wf-4y2 (clipboard behavior), wf-64m (cross-command UX)\n\n- Likely duplicates / related docs (files I read)\n  - README.md -- CLI overview & waif next description\n  - src/commands/next.ts -- implementation referenced for changes\n  - docs/dev/prd/TUI_PRD.md -- TUI PRD that references waif next workflows\n  - .opencode/command/prd.md -- PRD authoring spec (process conventions)\n  - .beads/issues.jsonl -- beads DB (I scanned for related issues)\n\n- Related issues (Beads ids)\n  - wf-3ur.1 -- \"Add --number/-n option to 'waif next'\"\n  - wf-4y2 -- \"waif next copies recommended issue ID to clipboard\"\n  - wf-64m -- \"CLI: when 'waif in-progress' finds no in_progress items, inform user and run 'waif next'\"\n  - wf-3ur.2 -- \"Add workflow stage tracking to WAIF CLI: Intake brief\"\n\n- Recommended next step\n  - UPDATE PRD at: docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md (seed or update the CLI PRD with the agent-aware waif next spec and acceptance criteria above).

{"data":{"assignee":"","createdAt":"2025-12-30T09:36:41.551Z","createdBy":"","deleteReason":"","deletedBy":"","description":"Problem\n\nThe WAIF CLI lacks a well-defined `/implement` command flow for agents to start implementation work tied to a Beads issue. Users expect `/implement <bd-id>` to claim and begin work; when no id is provided the command should detect the current in-progress bead (via `waif in-progress`) and fall back to `waif next` if nothing is in progress. If no id can be determined, the command should ask the user for the missing id and abort. The current repo has related commands (in-progress, next) but the intended `/implement` behavior and argument-handling rules are not captured in a single, testable implementation.\n\nUsers\n\n- Primary: AI agents and developers invoking the WAIF CLI to begin work tied to Beads issues.\n- Secondary: PMs and reviewers who rely on consistent branch & bd workflows.\n\nSuccess criteria\n\n- `/implement <bd-id>` accepts an explicit bead id and proceeds to create the topic branch and claim the issue (no merge/close).\n- If run without arguments: command runs the existing `waif in-progress`; if that returns an issue id, use it. If not, run `waif next` and use that id.\n- If no id can be determined after the above, the command prompts the user for the id and exits without making changes.\n- The command enforces the repo safety gate: if working tree is dirty, it stops and describes options (A–E) rather than making changes.\n- Unit/integration tests cover the three main flows: explicit id, auto-detect fallback to in-progress->next, and the 'no id' prompting behavior.\n\nConstraints\n\n- Must use `bd` for all issue tracking. Do not create markdown TODO lists.\n- Keep changes minimal and scoped to command arg handling and safety gate logic.\n- Follow existing branch naming and commit rules: do not commit directly to main; create a topic branch per issue.\n- Do not close the Beads issue until the PR is merged.\n\nExisting state\n\n- Existing CLI commands live under `src/commands/` (e.g., `inProgress.ts`, `next.ts`, `startWork.ts`).\n- No dedicated `/implement` command exists yet.\n- Relevant docs: `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and `.opencode/command/intake.md` describe expectations for agent-driven workflows.\n\nDesired change\n\n- Add a new CLI command `implement` (e.g., `src/commands/implement.ts`) that implements the argument handling and safety gate described above.\n- Add tests under `tests/` covering argument parsing and the three canonical flows.\n- Update docs or add a short note in `docs/Workflow.md` or `AGENTS.md` if required to reflect the new command behavior.\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs\n\n- docs/Workflow.md\n- AGENTS.md\n- .github/copilot-instructions.md\n- .opencode/command/intake.md\n\nRelated issues\n\n- No obvious existing issue implements this exact behavior (search done prior to creation).\n\nClarifying questions\n\n1. Should the command automatically create the branch from `origin/main` (recommended) or from the current branch when the repo is ahead/uncommitted? (Default: create from `origin/main` and carry uncommitted changes onto the new branch.)\n2.

The legacy tmux/probe and mixed event-driven wiring should be removed once the new scheduler is verified.\n\n## Users\n\n- Primary: Operators, Producers, and automation workflows needing periodic, reproducible probes or scheduled checks for situational awareness.\n- Secondary: Developers and CI owners who want deterministic scheduled runs and historical snapshots for audits and alerts.\n\n## Success criteria\n\n1) Scheduler reliably runs configured commands on schedule and appends sanitized JSONL snapshots to `history/` with shape:\n\n   { \"time\":\"<ISO8601>\", \"job_id\":\"<id>\", \"name\":\"<name>\", \"command\":\"<cmd>\", \"exit_code\":0, \"status\":\"success|failure|timeout\", \"summary\":\"<short>\", \"sanitized_output\":\"<trimmed/redacted text>\" }\n\n2) Config-driven schedules using cron syntax stored at `.waif/ooda-scheduler.yaml` (entries: `id`, `name`, `command`, `schedule`, `cwd?`, `env?`, `capture: [stdout,stderr]`, `redact: true`, `retention: { keep_last:100 }`).\n\n3) Remove all traces of the current OODA functionality from code, tests and docs (code paths, tests, docs referencing legacy tmux/probe logic must be removed or replaced) as part of the rollout/cleanup acceptance.\n\n4) Safe-by-default: sanitizer/redaction MUST reuse `src/lib/redact.ts`; never persist secrets or full message bodies. Default execution: repo-trusted, run as current user; per-job timeout default 60s (configurable).\n\n5) Observability and CI:\n   - CLI: `waif ooda schedule start|stop|run|status`; map `waif ooda --once` semantics to job runs for compatibility.\n   - Per-run logs, exit codes, and retention enforcement; optional `--log <path>` that appends to `history/ooda_scheduler_<job>.jsonl`.\n   - Tests: unit tests for scheduler logic; integration tests for run/write; CI E2E that runs a mock job and asserts snapshot creation.\n\n6) Rollout & migration:\n   - Implement the scheduler and tests on a feature branch; verify via CI E2E (mock job) and manual acceptance (`waif ooda schedule run <id>`).\n   - After verification, remove legacy code/tests/docs either in the same EPIC PR or via a paired cleanup PR linked in the epic; the removal is a required acceptance step.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- Must obey `.gitignore` and context-pack redaction rules; never persist secrets.\n- Default config path: `.waif/ooda-scheduler.yaml` (recommend file-permissions guidance in docs: `chmod 600`).\n- Default per-job timeout: 60s (overridable in config).\n- Retention default: `keep_last = 100` snapshots per job.\n- Scheduler MUST NOT invoke OpenCode slash-commands or agents.\n- Implementation must be idempotent; replacement goes live only after tests and manual acceptance.\n\n## Existing state (relevant)\n\n- `docs/dev/prd-ooda-loop.md` (current PRD to update)\n- `docs/dev/ooda_implementation_plan.md` (implementation plan)\n- `src/commands/ooda.ts` (current implementation to replace/refactor)\n- `.opencode/plugin/waif-ooda.ts` (plugin: review/retire as needed)\n- `src/lib/redact.ts` (redaction helper to reuse)\n- `tests/ooda*.test.ts` (update/remove as required)\n- `history/` pattern for snapshots exists (new snapshots to follow `history/ooda_scheduler_<job>.jsonl` pattern)\n- Beads parent/related: `wf-r1d`, `wf-r1d.5`, `wf-cvz.*`, `wf-ss7.*`, `wf-gmn`, `wf-xcq`.\n\n## Desired change (high-level)\n\nReplace existing OODA with Cron-style OODA Scheduler:\n\n- CLI and UX: `waif ooda schedule start|stop|run|status`; map `waif ooda --once/--json` semantics to job runs.\n- Config: `.waif/ooda-scheduler.yaml` (cron syntax); validate schema on load and warn on suspicious patterns.\n- Execution: run jobs on schedule, enforce timeout, capture stdout/stderr, sanitize output using `src/lib/redact.ts`, append JSONL snapshot to `history/`, and enforce retention policy.\n- Operators: immediate run (`waif ooda schedule run <id>`) for CI/testing and a safe enable/disable path.\n- Tests & CI: unit tests, integration tests, and CI E2E; include redaction unit tests for common secret patterns.\n- Cleanup: identify and remove or refactor legacy tmux/probe codepaths, tests, and docs after new implementation verification.\n\n## Files likely to be updated/removed (implementation owner to verify)\n\n- `docs/dev/prd-ooda-loop.md` (update canonical PRD)\n- `docs/dev/ooda_implementation_plan.md`\n- `src/commands/ooda.ts`\n- `.opencode/plugin/waif-ooda.ts`\n- `tests/ooda.*.test.ts` (add scheduler tests; remove legacy tests)\n- `history/ooda_scheduler_<job>.jsonl` pattern and retention enforcer\n- `docs/Workflow.md`, `README.md` (CLI examples)\n\n## Risks & assumptions\n\nRisks\n- Unsafe command execution: scheduled jobs can run arbitrary shell commands; require operator guidance and config permissions.\n- Secrets leakage: redaction helper may miss custom secret patterns; add unit tests and extend patterns as needed.\n- Timing-related test flakiness in CI E2E.\n- Platform differences (shell, PATH, permissions) may cause inconsistent behavior across OSs.\n\nAssumptions\n- Operators will restrict config file permissions and control jobs.\n- Scheduler runs as current user and is not privileged.\n- Redaction helper will be extended and unit-tested for new job outputs.\n- Legacy removal will occur only after successful CI and manual verification.\n\n## Recommended next step\n\n- UPDATE `docs/dev/prd-ooda-loop.md` to document Cron-style OODA Scheduler as canonical OODA, including: CLI, config schema, snapshot JSONL shape, retention, safety/redaction guidance, and migration checklist.\n- Create/update an EPIC under `wf-r1d` (done: `wf-e6r`) with sub-beads: implementation (patch), tests (patch), docs (scribbler), cleanup (patch + scribbler).

Blocker: working tree has uncommitted change to history/ooda_daily-health.jsonl and current branch is a merge topic (merge/wf-e6r.2.1.1-into-wf-e6r.2.1.config).

This guarantees the long-lived process in the pane keeps the canonical agent environment (BD_ACTOR/WAIF_AGENT/OPENCODE_AGENT) on its PID so probes (ooda) can reliably detect agent identity via /proc.<newline><newline>Why\\n- Problem: if the agent process daemonizes (forks), the PID visible to tmux may be a short-lived wrapper or shell; the actual agent process may have a different PID or environment, breaking /proc-based detection.\\n- Solution: add a no-daemon/foreground mode to startWork (honor BEADS_NO_DAEMON env or add --no-daemon flag) so the agent process remains the foreground process of the pane.\\n\\nScope (what this issue is NOT)\\n- Not changing production service behavior except when explicitly requested by pane startup scripts or interactive invocation. This is targeted at interactive tmux panes and dev/test runs.\\n\\nDeliverables\\n1) Code: Modify src/commands/startWork.ts to:\\n   - Honor an environment variable (BEADS_NO_DAEMON=1) or accept a flag (e.g., --no-daemon) to run the agent process in foreground (do not fork/daemonize).\\n   - Document behavior in command help and code comments.\\n2) Tests: Unit tests and/or integration tests that validate startWork launches an interactive shell process with environment vars set (mock spawn behavior).

Recommend supporting BEADS_NO_DAEMON env var for minimal changes to startup scripts.\\n2) Code change: in src/commands/startWork.ts, when BEADS_NO_DAEMON=1 or --no-daemon passed, avoid any behavior that would background or exec a separate daemon process; ensure spawnSync/spawn usage preserves foreground process semantics. If the underlying agent runtime has a built-in daemon mode, pass a flag to disable it.\\n3) Tests: Add unit tests mocking child_process spawn/spawnSync to ensure the environment and command-line used when BEADS_NO_DAEMON=1 results in foreground process invocation and that the PID in the pane can be inspected.\\n4) Docs & startup: ensure scripts/start-workflow-tmux.sh sets BEADS_NO_DAEMON=1 when launching panes (already done in recent change) and document the expected behavior.\\n5) Validation: run start-workflow-tmux.sh on a Linux host and check inside a pane: patch and run Agent     | Status | Title                                                                                              \n----------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nmuse      | Free   | Muse (Design)                                                                                      \nmap       | Free   | Map (PM)                                                                                           \nmuse      | Free   | Muse (Design)                                                                                      \npatch     | Free   | Patch (Impl)                                                                                       \nscribbler | Free   | Scribbler (Docs)                                                                                   \npixel     | Free   | Pixel (Art)                                                                                        \nprobe     | Free   | Probe (QA)                                                                                         \nship      | Free   | Ship (DevOps)                                                                                       to verify mapping.\\n6) Rollout: merge change behind a short migration note; this behavior only impacts interactive panes and should be safe for CI or server usage where daemonization may still be desired unless BEADS_NO_DAEMON is set.\\n\\nSuccess criteria\\n- When BEADS_NO_DAEMON=1 (or --no-daemon used),  runs as the foreground process (no immediate background daemonizing) and the PID of the pane process corresponds to the agent process that inherits BD_ACTOR/WAIF_AGENT.\\n- ooda probe maps panes to canonical agent names reliably in manual end-to-end tests.\\n- Tests added and passing locally (npm run build && npm test).\\n\\nOwner suggestion and schedule\\n- Owner: patch (implementation), map (PM) to coordinate and review docs.\\n- ETA: small change — 1-2 days for implementation, tests and PR review.\\n\\nRisks & mitigations\\n- Risk: Some use-cases expect daemonization (e.g., running agents under supervisor/daemon). Mitigation: this change is opt-in via env var or CLI flag — default behavior unchanged.\\n- Risk: Interactive shells or third-party tools may still background themselves. Mitigation: document the limitation; prefer process env detection as primary signal and maintain fallbacks.\\n\\nFollow-ups\\n- After merge, update scripts/start-workflow-tmux.sh and any pane spawners to set BEADS_NO_DAEMON for interactive panes (already changed in branch).\\n- Monitor any user reports about changed behavior and provide a rollback path (remove BEADS_NO_DAEMON export in startup scripts).\\n\n\nNotes\nFollow-up: implement no-daemon/foreground mode for waif startWork per plan.

{"data":{"assignee":"","createdAt":"2026-01-07T09:38:07.741Z","createdBy":"WAIF","deleteReason":"","deletedBy":"","description":"Final headline\n\nImplement an agent \"Implementation skill\" that, given a Producer-specified bead or intake, creates a feature branch, implements code changes (with tests and docs), pushes the branch, opens a GitHub PR with testing instructions and bead links, and records actions back to Beads. The agent may push branches and open PRs automatically; merges require a human reviewer after CI passes.\n\n\nProblem\n- There is no repo-scoped Implementation skill that can take a Producer request and produce a complete code change (branch + commits + tests + docs) and a GitHub PR. This slows delivery because engineers must manually implement trivial wiring and plumbing that could be automated, and it increases handoff friction for small, well-scoped work.\n\nUsers\n- Primary: Producers / PMs who request implementation work from the agent stack.\n- Secondary: Engineers and reviewers who will review, test, and merge PRs; automation (CI) that validates changes.\n\nSuccess criteria\n- Given a beads issue and confirmed scope, the Implementation skill:\n  1) Creates a topic branch following repo convention (<beads_prefix>-<bd-id>/<short-desc>) and produces one or more commits implementing the requested change, including tests and concise documentation.\n  2) Opens a GitHub PR with a clear body containing: intent, implementation overview, testing instructions (automated & manual), and links to the source bead(s).\n  3) Updates the originating bead(s) / epic(s) with links to the created PR(s) and a short summary of changed files; adds a \"next steps\" list for discovered but out-of-scope follow-ups.\n  4) Ensures CI/lint/tests pass before recommending merge; merges only after human reviewer approval (human-merge).\n  5) Is idempotent: re-running against the same bead does not create duplicate PRs or duplicate bead links.\n  - Done-test (explicit example): Running the skill against bd-123 creates branch bd-123/<short-desc>, opens PR linking bd-123, includes relevant tests and docs, CI passes, and bd-123 is updated with an external-ref to the PR and a short summary of files changed.\n\nConstraints\n- Security: No secrets may be added to commits, PR bodies, logs, or bead comments.\n- Branch & PR policy: Agent may push branches and open PRs automatically; merges require a human reviewer (no auto-merge).\n- Branch naming: Must follow <beads_prefix>-<bd-id>/<short-desc>.\n- Implementation must include tests and concise documentation and include clear instructions for automated and manual verification in the PR body.\n- The agent must not unilaterally change bead assignees without explicit Producer instruction (propose-only for assignment changes unless explicitly told otherwise).\n\nExisting state\n- .opencode/command/intake.md — intake process & interview templates to capture scope (agent: build).\n- .opencode/command/implement.md — implementation workflow for agents (agent: patch). Defines safety gate for uncommitted changes, definition checklist, automated review stages, commit/push/PR steps, and bead update rules.\n- .opencode/command/doc.md — docs authoring command (agent: scribbler). Defines pre-implementation doc responsibilities, temp draft location, and bead write-back process.\n- Other relevant .opencode/command files: plan.md, prd.md, review.md, testplan.md, landThePlane.md, design.md, milestones.md — these define adjacent steps (planning, PRD authoring, test guidance, review, landing) that the Implementation skill must integrate with or respect.\n- docs/dev/prd/opencode_integration_PRD.md — OpenCode integration PRD (parent epic wf-gn7).\n- docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md, docs/Workflow.md — repo context & PRD-driven workflow guidance.\n- Beads: wf-gn7 (OpenCode integration epic — chosen parent), wf-70j.* (PM/skill family: intake, PRD linking, plan generation), wf-5e2 (PM: decompose PRD into bead plan).\n\nDesired change\n- Implement an agent skill (\"Implementation skill\") that accepts a Producer-specified bead (or freeform request per /intake), implements the requested code changes on a branch, pushes the branch, opens a PR (with tests & docs), and records actions back to beads. Produce \"next step\" recommendations for any discovered out-of-scope work and link them from the bead.\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs\n- docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md — repo context & agent guidance\n- .opencode/command/intake.md — intake command and interview templates (read)\n- .opencode/command/implement.md — implementation command (defines expected implement flow)\n- .opencode/command/doc.md — documentation authoring command (pre-implementation docs)\n- docs/Workflow.md — PRD-driven workflow & policies\n- docs/dev/prd/opencode_integration_PRD.md — OpenCode integration PRD\n\nRelated issues (Beads ids)\n- wf-gn7 — OpenCode integration (recommended parent)\n- wf-70j, wf-70j.1, wf-70j.2, wf-70j.3, wf-70j.4, wf-70j.5, wf-70j.6 — PM skill and intake/PRD/bead-plan family (reference)\n- wf-5e2 — PM: decompose PRD into bead plan (related)\n\nRisks & assumptions\n- Branch protection or GitHub permissions may block agent pushes or PR creation depending on repository settings (confirm actor & permissions).\n- The PR actor (bot vs named user) affects branch protections, CI permissions, and audits — confirm desired actor.\n- Tests selection: the skill must determine the minimal, relevant tests to run; mis-selection could lead to false confidence.\n- Flaky CI/tests may delay human-merge or give false green status.\n- Idempotence detection: the skill must reliably detect existing PRs/branches to avoid duplicates (branch name + external-ref matching).\n- Human-merge delay: merges will wait for human approval which may lengthen cycle time.\n- Secret leakage risk: commits/PR bodies must be scanned to ensure no secrets are added.\n\nRecommended next step\n- UPDATE PRD at: docs/dev/prd/opencode_integration_PRD.md to add the Implementation-skill scope, security boundaries, acceptance tests, and enablement checklist; create the bead as a sub-issue under wf-gn7 once this intake is approved.\n\nAreas that could benefit from expansion (clarifying questions)\n- Audit trail format: do you want a mandatory bead comment format for every automated action (time, action, branch, PR URL)? (recommended)\n- CI gating: must CI be green before a human may merge, or should the skill only \"recommend merge\" when CI is green? (current draft assumes the skill requires CI green before recommending merge; human merges)\n- GitHub actor: should PRs appear from an agent bot account or a named human account? This affects CI permissions and branch protections.\n\nFiles / commands referenced\n- Files read:\n  - docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md\n  - .opencode/command/intake.md\n  - .opencode/command/implement.md\n  - .opencode/command/doc.md\n  - docs/dev/prd/opencode_integration_PRD.md (path discovered)\n- Command refs: bd create, bd update, bd sync, git commands per .opencode/command/implement.md\n\n\n\nNotes\nPR created: https://github.com/SorraTheOrc/waif/pull/95.

Prototype a minimal \"priming\" approach and capture decisions.\n\nKey takeaway / direction change\n------------------------------\nInstead of defaulting to automatic OpenCode-session context injection (\"bd prime\") as the primary approach, prefer an **explicit priming command** design:\n\n- Provide a WAIF command like `waif prime <beads-id>` (or an OpenCode command wrapper like `/waif-prime <beads-id>`), which generates a context pack for the specified Beads issue.\n- Allow different agents/roles to choose different bootstrap profiles (e.g., implementer vs reviewer) by varying the context pack.\n- Treat automatic session context injection as an optional reliability layer (e.g., recovery after compaction), not the default mechanism.\n\nThis is cleaner, less error-prone, and reduces the risk of injecting the wrong issue context.\n\nWhat opencode-beads suggests (reusable ideas)\n--------------------------------------------\n- \"bd-prime\" pattern: preload session context to reduce repeated lookups and recover after compaction.\n- /bd-* command surface mirroring the bd CLI for agent convenience.\n- Concept of a beads-task-agent (autonomous completion) \u0014 promising, but safety-sensitive.\n\nWAIF-specific requirements / changes needed\n------------------------------------------\n- Privacy/scope: prime content must be scoped to the active session + issue, with expiry to avoid cross-session leakage.\n- Permissions: any write operations (create/update/close) must require explicit policy checks and likely human-in-the-loop confirmation.\n- Auditability: actions triggered from OpenCode must be logged and linked to both the Beads issue and the OpenCode event/session.\n\nPrototype produced (POC)\n-----------------------\nPR #68: https://github.com/SorraTheOrc/waif/pull/68\n\n- `scripts/wf-gn7.1-inject.js`: minimal proof-of-concept script that POSTs a context payload to an OpenCode session endpoint (non-destructive). This demonstrates feasibility of the \"inject payload\" mechanism if we later need it for recovery.\n- `history/wf-gn7.1-spike.md`: earlier decision record (content migrated here per request).\n\nHow to test\n-----------\nOption A: with a real OpenCode runtime\n1) Checkout branch:\n   - `git fetch origin`\n   - `git checkout feature/wf-gn7.1.1-spike`\n\n2) Set env vars:\n   - `OPENCODE_URL` (base URL)\n   - `OPENCODE_API_KEY` (token)\n\n3) Run:\n   - `node scripts/wf-gn7.1-inject.js --session test-session-123 --context '{\"beads\":\"example-prime\"}'`\n\nExpected output: \"Context injected successfully\" or a clear error message.\n\nOption B: without OpenCode (local mock)\n1) Start mock server:\n   - `node -e \"const http=require('http');http.createServer((req,res)=>{let b='';req.on('data',c=>b+=c);req.on('end',()=>{console.log('RECEIVED',req.method,req.url,b);res.writeHead(200);res.end('ok');});}).listen(8080);console.log('listening 8080');\"`\n\n2) Run injector against it:\n   - `OPENCODE_URL=\"http://localhost:8080\" OPENCODE_API_KEY=dummy node scripts/wf-gn7.1-inject.js --session test-session-123 --context '{\"beads\":\"example-prime\"}'`\n\nFollow-up work recommended (create separately)\n---------------------------------------------\n- Implement `waif prime <beads-id>` context pack generator (explicit priming).\n- Add OpenCode wrapper command `/waif-prime <beads-id>` that calls the same generator.\n- Add automatic re-prime on compaction/session start only when bd-id is unambiguous.\n- Evaluate /bd-* command mirroring for read-only ops first.\n- Safety review for any autonomous task-agent: RBAC, rate limits, audit logs, human-in-the-loop.\n\nFiles touched in this spike\n---------------------------\n- history/wf-gn7.1-spike.md (created earlier)\n- scripts/wf-gn7.1-inject.js (created earlier)\n- PR: https://github.com/SorraTheOrc/waif/pull/68\n","id":"wf-gn7.1.1","issueType":"task","parentId":"wf-gn7.1","priority":"low","stage":"","status":"open","tags":[],"title":"Spike: review opencode-beads and prototype context injection","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T00:43:19.268Z"},"type":"workitem"}

{"data":{"assignee":"@AGENT","createdAt":"2026-01-21T08:20:40.361Z","createdBy":"WAIF","deleteReason":"","deletedBy":"","description":"Fix waif next: descend in-progress epic children/blockers to actionable leaf (test-first)\n\nProblem\n\n- When an Epic is `in_progress` and `waif next` determines that Epic is the top candidate, the command sometimes returns the Epic itself as the recommended item. This is not useful for Producers: they usually want the next actionable child or immediate blocker to work on, not the Epic container.\n\nUsers\n\n- Primary: Product Manager (Producer) running `waif next` to decide next work.\n- Secondary: Agents and engineers who consume `waif next --json` for automation.\n\nSuccess criteria\n\n1. A failing test is added that reproduces the current bug (test-first).\n   - Suggested test file: `tests/next.epic-inprogress.test.ts` (test-first reproducer).\n2. Implementation updates `src/commands/next.ts` so that when a selected top candidate is an Epic in `in_progress` the command:\n   - recursively prefers in-progress child/blocker chains and descends until reaching leaf nodes, and\n   - among leaf candidates, selects the one with the highest BV score (or falls back to existing deterministic tie-breakers).\n3. All existing `tests/next*.ts` pass, new test passes, and overall test suite remains green.\n4. Deterministic results for identical inputs (stable tie-breaking rules).\n5. `waif next --json` preserves the current JSON contract; `waif` metadata remains present and includes epic_context when applicable.\n6. No regressions for `--assignee`, search, or non-epic flows.\n\nConstraints\n\n- Read-only: command must not change Beads state.\n- Deterministic tie-breaking (BV -> priority -> created_at -> id).\n- Performance: recursion limited to direct child/blocker chains (do not traverse whole graph broadly).\n- Preserve existing JSON output shape for automation consumers.\n\nExisting state\n\n- Primary code: `src/commands/next.ts` (current selection logic, epic-aware branch exists but sometimes returns the Epic itself).\n- Tests: `tests/next.test.ts` covers many `waif next` behaviors; add a new failing test first.\n- Documentation: `docs/dev/prd/prd-command-next.md` documents desired search and epic-aware semantics.\n\nDesired change\n\n- Update selection algorithm in `src/commands/next.ts`:\n  1. When top-ranked candidate is an Epic with status `in_progress`, enter Epic-aware mode.\n  2. For that Epic, build the directed set composed of its direct children (parent-child) and immediate blockers (blocks relations).\n  3. If any related issue is `in_progress`, prefer those and recursively descend along any `in_progress` child/blocker chain until you reach one or more leaf nodes (issues that have no `in_progress` related child/blocker).\n  4. When leaf candidates are reached, choose the leaf with the highest BV score. If BV unavailable, fall back to the existing numeric priority -> created_at -> id tie-break.\n  5. Maintain and emit `waif.epic_context` in JSON output with `{ epic_id, epic_status, selection_reason, recommended_id }` so automation can detect epic-scoped recommendations.\n  6. Add one or more unit/integration tests that first assert the failing behavior (test-first), then validate the fix.\n\nRelated code\n\n- Primary implementation: `src/commands/next.ts`\n- Tests to update/add: `tests/next.test.ts` and `tests/next.epic-inprogress.test.ts`\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs\n\n- `docs/dev/prd/prd-command-next.md` (existing PRD covering epic-aware selection and search behavior)\n- `docs/Workflow.md` (how `waif next` fits into Producer flow)\n\nRelated Beads issues\n\n- wf-uctv (epic-aware selection — related source)\n- wf-3ur.1 (Add `--number` option — blocker for multi-suggestion flows)\n- wf-dak (Agent-specific waif next — related behavior)\n\nRecommended next step\n\n- UPDATE PRD at: `docs/dev/prd/prd-command-next.md` (document the bug, the test-first plan, and the refined recursion rule).\n\nPlanned Beads issue (do not create until you approve):\n\n- Type: `bug`\n- Priority: `0` (critical) — per your preference\n- Title (working): `bug: waif next returns epic when epic is in_progress — descend to in-progress child/blocker leaf`\n- Assignee: `Build`\n- Labels: `state:idea`\n\nI will create this Beads issue when you approve the intake; the PRD will be updated in place first.\n\nNotes / open questions\n\n- Confirm desired beads issue type and priority. This is a bug fix but the repository PRD exists; recommended issue type: `feature` with `priority 1` so work can be scheduled—confirm if you prefer `bug` instead.\n- Clarify whether recursion should follow both `parent-child` and `blocks` directions symmetrically; current proposal treats both as candidate relations and recurses when `in_progress` children/blockers exist.\n\nRisks & assumptions (added)\n\n- BV scores may be absent; code will fall back to numeric priority -> created_at -> id as documented.\n- Deep or cyclic dependency graphs are possible; recursion will be limited to direct relations and must avoid infinite loops by tracking visited ids.\n- Tests will be added test-first to ensure regression safety.\n","id":"wf-jgcz","issueType":"bug","parentId":null,"priority":"critical","stage":"","status":"completed","tags":["stage:done","stage:in_progress","stage:in_review","state:idea"],"title":"bug: waif next returns epic when epic is in_progress — descend to in-progress child/blocker leaf","updatedAt":"2026-01-21T09:33:40.292Z"},"type":"workitem"}

Remaining work: finalize wf-e6r.2.1 implementation branch, implement scheduler engine (wf-e6r.1), job runner (wf-e6r.4), snapshot writer/retention (wf-y6o), tests for runJobCommand (wf-uba), and docs (wf-e6r.2.3). Blocker: working tree has uncommitted change to history/ooda_daily-health.jsonl and current branch is a merge topic (merge/wf-e6r.2.1.1-into-wf-e6r.2.1.config). Action needed: stash/commit/finish merge or switch to a clean feature branch named wf-e6r.2/<short-desc> before continuing. Risks: potential E2E flakiness, redaction gaps, unsafe job commands — see epic wf-e6r for mitigation. Next steps recommended: 1) Resolve local merge/uncommitted file. 2) Patch: complete wf-e6r.2.1 and open PR. 3) Patch: implement wf-e6r.4 + wf-y6o and wf-uba tests. 4) Scribbler: deliver docs before merge. 5) Run CI E2E and manual acceptance then remove legacy.

Prototype a minimal \"priming\" approach and capture decisions.\n\nKey takeaway / direction change\n------------------------------\nInstead of defaulting to automatic OpenCode-session context injection (\"bd prime\") as the primary approach, prefer an **explicit priming command** design:\n\n- Provide a WAIF command like `waif prime <beads-id>` (or an OpenCode command wrapper like `/waif-prime <beads-id>`), which generates a context pack for the specified Beads issue.\n- Allow different agents/roles to choose different bootstrap profiles (e.g., implementer vs reviewer) by varying the context pack.\n- Treat automatic session context injection as an optional reliability layer (e.g., recovery after compaction), not the default mechanism.\n\nThis is cleaner, less error-prone, and reduces the risk of injecting the wrong issue context.\n\nWhat opencode-beads suggests (reusable ideas)\n--------------------------------------------\n- \"bd-prime\" pattern: preload session context to reduce repeated lookups and recover after compaction.\n- /bd-* command surface mirroring the bd CLI for agent convenience.\n- Concept of a beads-task-agent (autonomous completion) \u0014 promising, but safety-sensitive.\n\nWAIF-specific requirements / changes needed\n------------------------------------------\n- Privacy/scope: prime content must be scoped to the active session + issue, with expiry to avoid cross-session leakage.\n- Permissions: any write operations (create/update/close) must require explicit policy checks and likely human-in-the-loop confirmation.\n- Auditability: actions triggered from OpenCode must be logged and linked to both the Beads issue and the OpenCode event/session.\n\nPrototype produced (POC)\n-----------------------\nPR #68: https://github.com/SorraTheOrc/waif/pull/68\n\n- `scripts/wf-gn7.1-inject.js`: minimal proof-of-concept script that POSTs a context payload to an OpenCode session endpoint (non-destructive). This demonstrates feasibility of the \"inject payload\" mechanism if we later need it for recovery.\n- `history/wf-gn7.1-spike.md`: earlier decision record (content migrated here per request).\n\nHow to test\n-----------\nOption A: with a real OpenCode runtime\n1) Checkout branch:\n   - `git fetch origin`\n   - `git checkout feature/wf-gn7.1.1-spike`\n\n2) Set env vars:\n   - `OPENCODE_URL` (base URL)\n   - `OPENCODE_API_KEY` (token)\n\n3) Run:\n   - `node scripts/wf-gn7.1-inject.js --session test-session-123 --context '{\"beads\":\"example-prime\"}'`\n\nExpected output: \"Context injected successfully\" or a clear error message.\n\nOption B: without OpenCode (local mock)\n1) Start mock server:\n   - `node -e \"const http=require('http');http.createServer((req,res)=>{let b='';req.on('data',c=>b+=c);req.on('end',()=>{console.log('RECEIVED',req.method,req.url,b);res.writeHead(200);res.end('ok');});}).listen(8080);console.log('listening 8080');\"`\n\n2) Run injector against it:\n   - `OPENCODE_URL=\"http://localhost:8080\" OPENCODE_API_KEY=dummy node scripts/wf-gn7.1-inject.js --session test-session-123 --context '{\"beads\":\"example-prime\"}'`\n\nFollow-up work recommended (create separately)\n---------------------------------------------\n- Implement `waif prime <beads-id>` context pack generator (explicit priming).\n- Add OpenCode wrapper command `/waif-prime <beads-id>` that calls the same generator.\n- Add automatic re-prime on compaction/session start only when bd-id is unambiguous.\n- Evaluate /bd-* command mirroring for read-only ops first.\n- Safety review for any autonomous task-agent: RBAC, rate limits, audit logs, human-in-the-loop.\n\nFiles touched in this spike\n---------------------------\n- history/wf-gn7.1-spike.md (created earlier)\n- scripts/wf-gn7.1-inject.js (created earlier)\n- PR: https://github.com/SorraTheOrc/waif/pull/68\n","id":"wf-l8cq","issueType":"task","parentId":"wf-xmwm","priority":"low","stage":"","status":"open","tags":[],"title":"Spike: review opencode-beads and prototype context injection","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T08:33:07.007Z"},"type":"workitem"}

We need a `waif ask` command that accepts a prompt, sends it to an agent (default `Map`/`PM`), allows optionally prefixing the prompt with an agent name (e.g. `ask patch ...`), and returns the agent's response to the console in Markdown (or `--json`) with no session tracking (one-shot MVP).\n\nUsers\n\nPrimary: producers who need fast, ad-hoc answers in the terminal (PMs/engineers writing prompts).\nSecondary: CLI users and automation that may call `waif ask` from scripts; QA and docs teams who rely on predictable one-shot outputs.\n\nSuccess criteria\n\nMVP success is that a user can run `waif ask \"<prompt>\"` and receive a coherent agent response rendered as Markdown to the console (or machine-readable JSON when `--json` is passed). The UX/implementation goal: ask -> get response (no session), responses are stable Markdown and usable in pipelines.\n\nConstraints\n\nNo timeline or special constraints were specified. No session tracking or state persistence in MVP. Default agent is `Map` (PM); agent override via prefixing the prompt is required. No privacy/security constraints specified by requester.\n\nExisting state\n\n- The CLI contains a PRD/CLI design effort (`docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md`) and PRD-agent wiring work (`wf-ba2.3.6`, `wf-ba2.3.1`) that overlap with PRD generation and OpenCode integration. There is not a dedicated `waif ask` command implemented today.\n\nDesired change\n\nAdd a new `waif ask` CLI command that:\n- Accepts a prompt string or reads from stdin\n- Sends the prompt to a chosen agent (default `Map`/`PM`), allowing an agent name prefix to override\n- Returns the agent's response to stdout rendered as Markdown, or `--json` for machine output\n- Is one-shot only (no session persistence)\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs\n\n- `docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md`\n- `docs/Workflow.md` (intake/PRD workflow)\n- `docs/dev/TUI_PRD.md`\n- `docs/dev/implemented/find_next_PRD.md`\n\nRelated issues\n\n- `wf-ba2.3.1` - Minimal PRD generator (writes Markdown file)\n- `wf-ba2.3.6` - Wire waif prd command to PRD Agent workflow\n- `wf-ba2.3` - PRD Template & Validation (epic)\n- `wf-7m7` - Add waif command to validate implementation plan integrity (related CLI expansion)\n- `wf-soh` - Integrate marked-terminal markdown rendering for all CLI output (rendering pipeline)\n\nClarifying questions\n\n1. Confirm default agent: should `Map` (PM) be the default for `waif ask`?  \n2. Which output modes are required beyond `--json` and rendered Markdown (e.g., raw text, exit codes for partial failures)?  \n3. Should `waif ask` support reading prompts from stdin or files for scripting?  \n4. Is any prompt auditing/logging required (even minimal), or must MVP avoid writing prompts anywhere?  \n5. Are there agent name parsing rules (single token prefix vs multiple-word agent names)?\n\nProposed next step\n\nNEW PRD at: `docs/dev/waif_ask_PRD.md`\nRecommended next command: `/prd docs/dev/waif_ask_PRD.md <issue-id>`","id":"wf-lp0","issueType":"feature","parentId":null,"priority":"medium","stage":"","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"waif ask: one-shot CLI agent query","updatedAt":"2025-12-22T23:55:32.463Z"},"type":"workitem"}

The first scoped deliverable:\n\n- CLI orchestration command `waif id start` (alias `wf id start` optional) that:\n  - Verifies clean working tree and required tools (`git`, `bd`) are present; otherwise abort with remediation steps\n  - Idempotently claims the bead via `bd update <id> --status in_progress` (no forced takeover)\n  - Creates a local topic branch with the canonical name: `bd-<id>/<short-desc>`\n    - `bd-<id>` is the bead numeric id (e.g., `bd-123`); `short-desc` is derived from the bead title: lowercase, punctuation removed, spaces -> hyphens, max 40 chars\n    - Examples: bead title `Add intake wrapper` -> branch `bd-123/add-intake-wrapper`\n  - Leaves branch local (no push); prints a one-line audit message and suggests `git push -u origin <branch>` when user is ready\n  - Adds a single bead comment like: `Branch created: bd-123/add-intake-wrapper (local)` and also runs `bd update <id> --external-ref \"branch:bd-123/add-intake-wrapper\"` to record the ref\n  - Supports `--dry-run` to show intended actions without making changes\n\nNon-goals (initial)\n\n- Do not push branches or create PRs automatically\n- Do not automatically complete or close beads\n- Do not perform interactive OpenCode interviews by default; launching OpenCode (if supported) must be explicit and interactive\n\nIdempotence and safety details\n\n- If branch already exists locally: command checks it points at expected commit (if determinable) and reuses it; do not recreate\n- If bead already claimed by same actor: do not re-comment repeatedly; optionally update comment timestamp or leave a single marker comment\n- If bead is claimed by a different actor: abort and explain options (request transfer via bd, or user can force with explicit flag)\n\nRisks & assumptions\n\n- Assumes `bd` CLI is available and the user has permission to update beads\n- Assumes branch naming convention is acceptable to teams; we may need to tune `short-desc` sanitation rules for edge cases\n- Idempotent commenting may require reading existing bead comments which could be slow; keep minimal interactions\n\nRelated beads / history\n\n- wf-70j.2.1 — waif intake command (related; do NOT subsume — keep as separate child/related item)\n- wf-ba2.3.6 — Wire waif prd command to PRD Agent workflow\n- wf-mj5 — Docs: Resolve TBDs in docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md\n\nOpen questions\n\n1) Branch push behaviour: default is local-only.

Idempotence goals are explicit; `--push` and alias features remain out of initial scope (deferred).\n\n- Finished Related-work & traceability review: Related beads are listed and intentionally not subsumed. When creating the epic, include explicit links to `wf-70j.2.1` and any child tasks to preserve traceability.\n\n- Finished Risks & assumptions review: Reiterated that `bd` availability and permissions are required; idempotent commenting may require scanning existing bead comments (watch for pagination/rate limits).

Mock spawnSync where appropriate to make tests deterministic.\\n4) Build and test: run the project's test/build commands and verify manual checks: from two different directories run waif --version and confirm identical output.\\n5) Open a PR from wf-08k/git-cwd-fix -> origin/main, include link to wf-08k, describe changes, list acceptance criteria.\\n\\nFiles inspected during triage:\\n- src/lib/version.ts\\n- dist/lib/version.js\\n- dist/index.js\\n- /home/rgardler/.npm-global/bin/waif (symlink)\\n\\nAcceptance criteria (summary):\\n- getCliVersion returns the same value regardless of caller CWD when package repo has .git.\\n- spawnSync git calls run with cwd set to package root.\\n- hasGitDir checks pkg root .git.\\n- Tests added and CI passing.\\n\\nWhen you open the PR, please update wf-08k with the PR URL and set status to in_review.

{"data":{"assignee":"","createdAt":"2026-01-14T04:46:12.033Z","createdBy":"WAIF","deleteReason":"","deletedBy":"","description":"/delegate @ship\n\nRationale\n\nWe want GitHub Copilot to produce an automated review when a PR is first opened, but not to re-run when the PR receives subsequent pushes/updates. This reduces noise while preserving a first-pass automated review. Ship (CI/Repo admin) should configure the repo appropriately (either via the official Copilot-for-PRs GitHub App settings or via a minimal GitHub Actions workflow) and validate behaviour.\n\nScope & constraints\n\n- Do NOT change or rely on local uncommitted files in the main repo workspace. Create branches from origin/main for any workflow file changes.\n- Prefer repo-level GitHub App configuration (preferred, least-privilege) over writing a workflow that uses an elevated PAT. If App installation is not possible (organization policy), implement a scoped GitHub Actions workflow that calls Copilot action/API and is triggered only on pull_request types: [opened].\n- Document exact permission grants and secrets / tokens needed. Avoid using tokens with broad org-level permissions.\n\nAcceptance criteria (concrete)\n\n1) When a PR is opened in this repository, Copilot (or the configured automation) posts an automated review/comment summarizing high-level issues (lint/test failures, quick suggestions or review notes) within 10 minutes of PR creation.\n2) When subsequent commits are pushed to the same PR (pull_request:synchronize), the Copilot automation does NOT post new automated reviews/comments. (It may update an existing comment only if you choose that behaviour, but it must not create a new review on synchronize.)\n3) Demonstration: create a short test PR (branch: ci/copilot-pr-check) that triggers the behaviour and capture: PR URL, link to the Copilot review/comment, and timeline showing it ran on PR opened and did not run on a follow-up push.\n4) Documentation: add history/github-copilot-pr.md describing the chosen implementation, configuration steps (App install or workflow file), permissions granted, and how to revert. If a workflow file was added, place it at .github/workflows/copilot-pr-review.yml and include the job trigger definition showing it only runs on pull_request: types: [opened].\n5) Security/audit: list any tokens or secrets used and recommend rotation/least-privilege scope. If an org-admin is required to complete the work, escalate and document the required admin action.\n\nDeliverables (expected)\n\n- Either: GitHub App configured for “Copilot for PRs” with settings changed to only run on PR opened (preferred). OR: Workflow file .github/workflows/copilot-pr-review.yml that triggers only on PR opened and calls the Copilot review action/API.\n- A short test PR (ci/copilot-pr-check) demonstrating the behaviour (opened → Copilot review posted; push new commit → no new review created).\n- Documentation at history/github-copilot-pr.md documenting steps, permissions, and test evidence.\n- A bd comment on this task with commands run, PR URL(s), and verification evidence.\n\nSuggested steps & example commands\n\n(1) Check app availability and install/configure (preferred):\n- Inspect repo Installations: gh api repos/:owner/:repo/installation --jq '.id' (or use org UI)\n- If Copilot for PRs is available as a GitHub App, configure its event subscriptions or settings to only act on pull_request.opened events (consult org admin if needed)\n\n(2) If App install is not possible, create a minimal Actions workflow (example trigger):\n- Create branch: git fetch origin && git checkout -b copilot-pr/setup origin/main\n- Add .github/workflows/copilot-pr-review.yml with:\n  on:\n    pull_request:\n      types: [opened]\n  jobs:\n    copilot_review:\n      runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n      steps:\n        - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        - name: Run Copilot review (choose action or script that calls Copilot)\n          run: |\n            # call copilot review API or action here\n\n(3) Test & validate:\n- gh pr create --title \"test: copilot pr review\" --head copilot-pr/setup --base main\n- Capture PR URL and verify Copilot posted a review shortly after open\n- Push a dummy commit to the PR and confirm no additional automated review is created\n\nPriority & timebox\n\nPriority: 2 (medium). Timebox: initial implementation + test within 2 working days. If App-level permissions or org-admin involvement is required, escalate immediately and post a blocker on the bd issue.\n\nNotes on least-privilege\n\n- Prefer using the GitHub App (Copilot for PRs) which scopes itself via the App installation instead of storing tokens in repo secrets.\n- If using Actions, create a dedicated machine user / token with minimal repo scope and document it.\n\nPlease acknowledge pickup on this bd task and post the first commands you will run. If you need org-admin permissions, escalate immediately and document the required action.\n\n\n\nNotes\n/delegate @ship\n\nDo this now (authoritative handoff)\n\nRationale\n- We need GitHub Copilot to post an automated review only when a PR is first opened, and NOT to create new automated reviews on subsequent PR updates. This reduces noise while preserving a first-pass automated review.\n\nScope (pick ONE approach and implement):\nA) Preferred — GitHub App configuration\n   - If the Copilot-for-PRs GitHub App is installable/configurable for this repo, update its settings so it runs on pull_request:opened only (or equivalent \"Run on PR open\" toggle) and does not run on pull_request:synchronize. Document the exact setting changed and provide evidence (screenshot link or setting dump) in the bd comment.\nB) Fallback — GitHub Actions workflow\n   - Add a minimal workflow at .github/workflows/copilot-pr-review.yml that triggers only on pull_request: types: [opened] and invokes the Copilot review action/API with least-privilege credentials. Document secrets used and their minimal scopes.\n\nAcceptance criteria (must meet to close wf-8re)\n1) On PR open, Copilot posts an automated review/comment within 10 minutes summarizing quick findings.\n2) On subsequent pushes to the same PR (pull_request:synchronize), no new automated Copilot review/comment is created. (Updating an existing comment is acceptable if documented, but do NOT create a new review on synchronize.)\n3) Demonstration: Create test PRs to show behaviour: ci/copilot-pr-check (open → Copilot review posted) and ci/copilot-pr-check-updated (push new commit → no new review). Provide PR URLs and timestamps.\n4) Documentation: add history/github-copilot-pr.md describing chosen approach, commands run, permissions/secrets used, how to revert, and test evidence.\n5) Post a bd comment on wf-8re with exact git/gh commands run, PR URLs, and verification evidence. If org-admin action was required, include the escalation details.\n\nConstraints & notes\n- Do NOT base branches on local uncommitted changes. Always create branches from origin/main.\n- Prefer the App route for least privilege. If App change requires org-admin, escalate immediately and document the requested admin action.\n- If using Actions, use a machine user token with minimal repo scope and document rotation/expiry recommendation.\n\nImmediate steps (exact commands to run now)\n1) Check App availability:\n   - git fetch origin\n   - gh api repos/:owner/:repo/installation --jq '.id' || echo \"No App installation info available\"\n   - If App present, inspect its settings in the GitHub UI and change to run on PR opened only (document the UI path and exact toggles changed).\n2) If App route unavailable, implement workflow:\n   - git fetch origin && git checkout -b copilot-pr/setup origin/main\n   - Create .github/workflows/copilot-pr-review.yml with 'on: pull_request: types: [opened]'\n   - git add .github/workflows/copilot-pr-review.yml && git commit -m \"wf-8re: add Copilot PR-on-open workflow\" && git push -u origin copilot-pr/setup\n   - gh pr create --title \"ci: copilot-pr-check\" --head copilot-pr/setup --base main --body \"Test: Copilot PR-on-open behaviour. References bd#wf-8re\"\n3) Create a short test PR branch to demonstrate behaviour:\n   - git checkout -b ci/copilot-pr-check origin/main && gh pr create --title \"test: copilot pr check\" --head ci/copilot-pr-check --base main\n\nReporting & handoff\n- Post an acknowledgement comment on bd#wf-8re with the exact commands you ran and their outputs (copy-paste). Include PR URLs and evidence (timestamps, screenshots or links) showing Copilot ran on open and not on synchronize.\n- If you need org-admin permissions to change App settings, post a blocker comment on wf-8re and escalate to the Producer with the exact admin steps required.\n\nTimebox\n- Priority: P2. Target initial implementation + demo within 2 working days. Escalate immediately if admin privileges are required.\n\nFiles expected to be created/edited if using Actions route:\n- .github/workflows/copilot-pr-review.yml\n- history/github-copilot-pr.md\n- Branches: copilot-pr/setup and ci/copilot-pr-check\n\nPlease acknowledge pickup on bd#wf-8re and post the first commands you run. Then proceed to implement the chosen approach and post PR/verification links.\n\nNOTE: Do not run these steps on the main working tree if there are local uncommitted changes; create a fresh branch from origin/main or use a worktree/clone instead.","id":"wf-ns6m","issueType":"task","parentId":null,"priority":"medium","stage":"","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Enable Copilot PR review only on PR open","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T08:33:07.467Z"},"type":"workitem"}

{"data":{"assignee":"","createdAt":"2026-01-07T09:38:07.741Z","createdBy":"WAIF","deleteReason":"","deletedBy":"","description":"Final headline\n\nImplement an agent \"Implementation skill\" that, given a Producer-specified bead or intake, creates a feature branch, implements code changes (with tests and docs), pushes the branch, opens a GitHub PR with testing instructions and bead links, and records actions back to Beads. The agent may push branches and open PRs automatically; merges require a human reviewer after CI passes.\n\n\nProblem\n- There is no repo-scoped Implementation skill that can take a Producer request and produce a complete code change (branch + commits + tests + docs) and a GitHub PR. This slows delivery because engineers must manually implement trivial wiring and plumbing that could be automated, and it increases handoff friction for small, well-scoped work.\n\nUsers\n- Primary: Producers / PMs who request implementation work from the agent stack.\n- Secondary: Engineers and reviewers who will review, test, and merge PRs; automation (CI) that validates changes.\n\nSuccess criteria\n- Given a beads issue and confirmed scope, the Implementation skill:\n  1) Creates a topic branch following repo convention (<beads_prefix>-<bd-id>/<short-desc>) and produces one or more commits implementing the requested change, including tests and concise documentation.\n  2) Opens a GitHub PR with a clear body containing: intent, implementation overview, testing instructions (automated & manual), and links to the source bead(s).\n  3) Updates the originating bead(s) / epic(s) with links to the created PR(s) and a short summary of changed files; adds a \"next steps\" list for discovered but out-of-scope follow-ups.\n  4) Ensures CI/lint/tests pass before recommending merge; merges only after human reviewer approval (human-merge).\n  5) Is idempotent: re-running against the same bead does not create duplicate PRs or duplicate bead links.\n  - Done-test (explicit example): Running the skill against bd-123 creates branch bd-123/<short-desc>, opens PR linking bd-123, includes relevant tests and docs, CI passes, and bd-123 is updated with an external-ref to the PR and a short summary of files changed.\n\nConstraints\n- Security: No secrets may be added to commits, PR bodies, logs, or bead comments.\n- Branch & PR policy: Agent may push branches and open PRs automatically; merges require a human reviewer (no auto-merge).\n- Branch naming: Must follow <beads_prefix>-<bd-id>/<short-desc>.\n- Implementation must include tests and concise documentation and include clear instructions for automated and manual verification in the PR body.\n- The agent must not unilaterally change bead assignees without explicit Producer instruction (propose-only for assignment changes unless explicitly told otherwise).\n\nExisting state\n- .opencode/command/intake.md — intake process & interview templates to capture scope (agent: build).\n- .opencode/command/implement.md — implementation workflow for agents (agent: patch). Defines safety gate for uncommitted changes, definition checklist, automated review stages, commit/push/PR steps, and bead update rules.\n- .opencode/command/doc.md — docs authoring command (agent: scribbler). Defines pre-implementation doc responsibilities, temp draft location, and bead write-back process.\n- Other relevant .opencode/command files: plan.md, prd.md, review.md, testplan.md, landThePlane.md, design.md, milestones.md — these define adjacent steps (planning, PRD authoring, test guidance, review, landing) that the Implementation skill must integrate with or respect.\n- docs/dev/prd/opencode_integration_PRD.md — OpenCode integration PRD (parent epic wf-gn7).\n- docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md, docs/Workflow.md — repo context & PRD-driven workflow guidance.\n- Beads: wf-gn7 (OpenCode integration epic — chosen parent), wf-70j.* (PM/skill family: intake, PRD linking, plan generation), wf-5e2 (PM: decompose PRD into bead plan).\n\nDesired change\n- Implement an agent skill (\"Implementation skill\") that accepts a Producer-specified bead (or freeform request per /intake), implements the requested code changes on a branch, pushes the branch, opens a PR (with tests & docs), and records actions back to beads. Produce \"next step\" recommendations for any discovered out-of-scope work and link them from the bead.\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs\n- docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md — repo context & agent guidance\n- .opencode/command/intake.md — intake command and interview templates (read)\n- .opencode/command/implement.md — implementation command (defines expected implement flow)\n- .opencode/command/doc.md — documentation authoring command (pre-implementation docs)\n- docs/Workflow.md — PRD-driven workflow & policies\n- docs/dev/prd/opencode_integration_PRD.md — OpenCode integration PRD\n\nRelated issues (Beads ids)\n- wf-gn7 — OpenCode integration (recommended parent)\n- wf-70j, wf-70j.1, wf-70j.2, wf-70j.3, wf-70j.4, wf-70j.5, wf-70j.6 — PM skill and intake/PRD/bead-plan family (reference)\n- wf-5e2 — PM: decompose PRD into bead plan (related)\n\nRisks & assumptions\n- Branch protection or GitHub permissions may block agent pushes or PR creation depending on repository settings (confirm actor & permissions).\n- The PR actor (bot vs named user) affects branch protections, CI permissions, and audits — confirm desired actor.\n- Tests selection: the skill must determine the minimal, relevant tests to run; mis-selection could lead to false confidence.\n- Flaky CI/tests may delay human-merge or give false green status.\n- Idempotence detection: the skill must reliably detect existing PRs/branches to avoid duplicates (branch name + external-ref matching).\n- Human-merge delay: merges will wait for human approval which may lengthen cycle time.\n- Secret leakage risk: commits/PR bodies must be scanned to ensure no secrets are added.\n\nRecommended next step\n- UPDATE PRD at: docs/dev/prd/opencode_integration_PRD.md to add the Implementation-skill scope, security boundaries, acceptance tests, and enablement checklist; create the bead as a sub-issue under wf-gn7 once this intake is approved.\n\nAreas that could benefit from expansion (clarifying questions)\n- Audit trail format: do you want a mandatory bead comment format for every automated action (time, action, branch, PR URL)? (recommended)\n- CI gating: must CI be green before a human may merge, or should the skill only \"recommend merge\" when CI is green? (current draft assumes the skill requires CI green before recommending merge; human merges)\n- GitHub actor: should PRs appear from an agent bot account or a named human account? This affects CI permissions and branch protections.\n\nFiles / commands referenced\n- Files read:\n  - docs/dev/CONTEXT_PACK.md\n  - .opencode/command/intake.md\n  - .opencode/command/implement.md\n  - .opencode/command/doc.md\n  - docs/dev/prd/opencode_integration_PRD.md (path discovered)\n- Command refs: bd create, bd update, bd sync, git commands per .opencode/command/implement.md\n\n\n\nNotes\nPR created: https://github.com/SorraTheOrc/waif/pull/95.

We should instead consume OpenCode events (see https://opencode.ai/docs/plugins/#events) to reliably track agent lifecycle (start/stop) and messages. This intake specifies an iterative implementation: v1 logs events of interest to the console; v2 detects agent start/stop reliably; v3 persists status to a YAML record.\n\nUsers\nPrimary users: the OODA Monitor operator (local developer running `waif ooda`) and the OODA monitor process itself. No secondary stakeholders were identified.\n\nSuccess criteria\n- v1 (console logs): `agent.started`, `agent.stopped`, and message-returned events appear in console logs; manual verification is acceptable initially; explore integration testability for automated verification.\n- v2 (detection): identify which agent starts and stops with 99.999% reliability (operational acceptance). Detection latency targets TBD in follow-ups.\n- v3 (persistent state): write a YAML status record during runtime to `history/` (permanent record) and maintain an in-memory cache for execution; console shows table of known agents with fields (agent, status, last_seen, source).\n\nConstraints\n- Priority: P0 (as requested).\n- Parent: wf-gn7.1 (WAIF OpenCode Plugin) — this issue is a child of that epic.\n- Timeline: no hard deadline specified.\n- Backwards compatibility: not required for this work (experimental acceptable).\n\nExisting state\n- Current ooda implementation uses pane titles and PID probes to infer agent state; this is implemented in `src/commands/ooda.ts` and supporting spike artifacts exist (scripts/ooda_probe.sh, history/ooda_probe_*.txt, history/ooda_heuristics.md).\n- Existing PRD and docs: `docs/dev/prd-ooda-loop.md` (OODA PRD), `history/ooda_command_PRD.md` (draft), and `docs/dev/opencode_integration_PRD.md` (OpenCode plugin PRD). Beads tasks exist: wf-cvz (ooda intake), wf-cvz.1 (probe spike), wf-cvz.2 (CLI work), and the OpenCode epic wf-gn7.1.\n\nDesired change\n- Integrate OpenCode plugin events as the canonical source of agent lifecycle events for the OODA monitor.\n- Implement iterative delivery:\n  - v1: subscribe to OpenCode events and log `agent.started`, `agent.stopped`, and message-returned events to console/log path. Provide `--log` support (existing CLI supports `--log` and `history/` defaults).\n  - v2: implement reliable mapping from events to agent identities (use existing agent map/fallbacks) and reach 99.999% identification reliability.\n  - v3: maintain an in-memory status cache and persist a YAML status snapshot to `history/ooda_status.yaml` (or similar) on changes or periodic flush.\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs\n- docs/dev/prd-ooda-loop.md\n- history/ooda_command_PRD.md\n- docs/dev/opencode_integration_PRD.md\n- src/commands/ooda.ts\n- src/lib/opencode.ts\n- scripts/ooda_probe.sh\n- history/ooda_probe_*.txt\n\nRelated issues (Beads IDs)\n- wf-gn7.1 — WAIF OpenCode Plugin (parent)\n- wf-cvz — ooda intake (epic)\n- wf-cvz.1 — Spike: collect tmux probe data for ooda (closed)\n- wf-cvz.2 — Implement CLI: waif ooda start/stop and logging (open)\n\nClarifying questions\n1) Confirm exact event names to subscribe to (suggested: `agent.started`, `agent.stopped`, `agent.message` / `message.returned`). Are these acceptable, or do you want alternative names/schema?\n2) For v1 automated testing: do you want a minimal OpenCode mock server in tests (preferred) or a plan to run a real OpenCode instance in CI? Which approach is acceptable for initial integration tests?\n3) For v3 YAML schema: confirm required fields (suggested: agent, status, last_seen (ISO8601), source (opencode|probe), optional metadata). Any additions?\n4) Retention/rotation for history/ooda_status.yaml: should we keep a single file (overwrite) or append timestamped snapshots for auditability?\n5) Any security/privacy constraints around logging agent messages that we must observe?\n\nProposed next step\n- UPDATE PRD at: docs/dev/prd-ooda-loop.md\n- Recommended next command (after confirming): /prd docs/dev/prd-ooda-loop.md <new-issue-id>\n\nLinked PRD: docs/dev/prd-ooda-loop.md\n\nNotes\nCommitted local beads updates, ran tests (npm test -> all unit tests passed).

This leads to AI agents creating minimal issues without the structured documentation that templates provide. Adding template guidance would:\n\n1. Improve issue quality by encouraging use of structured templates\n2. Ensure bugs include reproduction steps and environment details\n3. Ensure features capture design decisions and alternatives considered\n4. Maintain consistency across issues created by different AI agents\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **AI Agent Onboarding**: When a new AI agent runs `bd onboard`, it learns to use templates for bugs, features, and epics automatically\n2. **Existing Projects**: Teams can regenerate AGENTS.md with updated best practices by re-running `bd onboard`\n3. **Documentation Consistency**: All projects using beads get consistent, high-quality issue documentation\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nModify the `bd onboard` command output in two places:\n\n1. **AGENTS.md content**: Update the \"Create new issues\" section to show template usage:\n   ```bash\n   # For bugs and features, use templates for structured documentation\n   bd create \"Bug title\" --from-template bug -p 1 --json\n   bd create \"Feature title\" --from-template feature -p 2 --json\n   ```\n\n2. **Add Templates section** after \"MCP Server\" section with:\n   - List of available templates (bug, feature, epic)\n   - When to use each template\n   - When to skip templates (tasks/chores)\n   - Template viewing commands\n\n3. **Update Important Rules** to include: \"Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\"\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n- **Alternative 1**: Add template suggestions to `bd create` command itself (e.g., prompt \"Use --from-template?\")\n  - Why not chosen: Too intrusive for human users who may prefer quick issue creation\n  \n- **Alternative 2**: Create separate `bd onboard --with-templates` flag\n  - Why not chosen: Splits the onboarding experience; templates should be default best practice\n\nNotes\nReference implementation: This project's AGENTS.md and .github/copilot-instructions.md files contain the exact changes needed.\n\nUpstream repo: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads\n\nNext steps:\n1. Fork the beads repository\n2. Locate the onboard command source (likely cmd/onboard.go)\n3. Apply the template guidance additions shown in this project\n4.

Default execution: repo-trusted, run as current user; per-job timeout default 60s (configurable).\n\n5) Observability and CI:\n   - CLI: `waif ooda schedule start|stop|run|status`; map `waif ooda --once` semantics to job runs for compatibility.\n   - Per-run logs, exit codes, and retention enforcement; optional `--log <path>` that appends to `history/ooda_scheduler_<job>.jsonl`.\n   - Tests: unit tests for scheduler logic; integration tests for run/write; CI E2E that runs a mock job and asserts snapshot creation.\n\n6) Rollout & migration:\n   - Implement the scheduler and tests on a feature branch; verify via CI E2E (mock job) and manual acceptance (`waif ooda schedule run <id>`).\n   - After verification, remove legacy code/tests/docs either in the same EPIC PR or via a paired cleanup PR linked in the epic; the removal is a required acceptance step.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- Must obey `.gitignore` and context-pack redaction rules; never persist secrets.\n- Default config path: `.waif/ooda-scheduler.yaml` (recommend file-permissions guidance in docs: `chmod 600`).\n- Default per-job timeout: 60s (overridable in config).\n- Retention default: `keep_last = 100` snapshots per job.\n- Scheduler MUST NOT invoke OpenCode slash-commands or agents.\n- Implementation must be idempotent; replacement goes live only after tests and manual acceptance.\n\n## Existing state (relevant)\n\n- `docs/dev/prd-ooda-loop.md` (current PRD to update)\n- `docs/dev/ooda_implementation_plan.md` (implementation plan)\n- `src/commands/ooda.ts` (current implementation to replace/refactor)\n- `.opencode/plugin/waif-ooda.ts` (plugin: review/retire as needed)\n- `src/lib/redact.ts` (redaction helper to reuse)\n- `tests/ooda*.test.ts` (update/remove as required)\n- `history/` pattern for snapshots exists (new snapshots to follow `history/ooda_scheduler_<job>.jsonl` pattern)\n- Beads parent/related: `wf-r1d`, `wf-r1d.5`, `wf-cvz.*`, `wf-ss7.*`, `wf-gmn`, `wf-xcq`.\n\n## Desired change (high-level)\n\nReplace existing OODA with Cron-style OODA Scheduler:\n\n- CLI and UX: `waif ooda schedule start|stop|run|status`; map `waif ooda --once/--json` semantics to job runs.\n- Config: `.waif/ooda-scheduler.yaml` (cron syntax); validate schema on load and warn on suspicious patterns.\n- Execution: run jobs on schedule, enforce timeout, capture stdout/stderr, sanitize output using `src/lib/redact.ts`, append JSONL snapshot to `history/`, and enforce retention policy.\n- Operators: immediate run (`waif ooda schedule run <id>`) for CI/testing and a safe enable/disable path.\n- Tests & CI: unit tests, integration tests, and CI E2E; include redaction unit tests for common secret patterns.\n- Cleanup: identify and remove or refactor legacy tmux/probe codepaths, tests, and docs after new implementation verification.\n\n## Files likely to be updated/removed (implementation owner to verify)\n\n- `docs/dev/prd-ooda-loop.md` (update canonical PRD)\n- `docs/dev/ooda_implementation_plan.md`\n- `src/commands/ooda.ts`\n- `.opencode/plugin/waif-ooda.ts`\n- `tests/ooda.*.test.ts` (add scheduler tests; remove legacy tests)\n- `history/ooda_scheduler_<job>.jsonl` pattern and retention enforcer\n- `docs/Workflow.md`, `README.md` (CLI examples)\n\n## Risks & assumptions\n\nRisks\n- Unsafe command execution: scheduled jobs can run arbitrary shell commands; require operator guidance and config permissions.\n- Secrets leakage: redaction helper may miss custom secret patterns; add unit tests and extend patterns as needed.\n- Timing-related test flakiness in CI E2E.\n- Platform differences (shell, PATH, permissions) may cause inconsistent behavior across OSs.\n\nAssumptions\n- Operators will restrict config file permissions and control jobs.\n- Scheduler runs as current user and is not privileged.\n- Redaction helper will be extended and unit-tested for new job outputs.\n- Legacy removal will occur only after successful CI and manual verification.\n\n## Recommended next step\n\n- UPDATE `docs/dev/prd-ooda-loop.md` to document Cron-style OODA Scheduler as canonical OODA, including: CLI, config schema, snapshot JSONL shape, retention, safety/redaction guidance, and migration checklist.\n- Create/update an EPIC under `wf-r1d` (done: `wf-e6r`) with sub-beads: implementation (patch), tests (patch), docs (scribbler), cleanup (patch + scribbler). Assign implementation owner (patch) and PM coordination (map). Link related beads: `wf-r1d.5`, `wf-xcq`, `wf-ss7.*`.\n\n## Example config snippet\n\n`.waif/ooda-scheduler.yaml`\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  - id: daily-health\n    name: \"Daily health probe\"\n    schedule: \"0 6 * * *\"  # daily at 06:00 UTC\n    command: \"scripts/health_check.sh\"\n    cwd: \".\"\n    env:\n      NODE_ENV: production\n    capture: [\"stdout\",\"stderr\"]\n    redact: true\n    timeout_seconds: 60\n    retention:\n      keep_last: 100\n```\n\n## Example snapshot line (JSONL)\n\n```json\n{\"time\":\"2026-01-08T12:00:00Z\",\"job_id\":\"daily-health\",\"name\":\"Daily health probe\",\"command\":\"scripts/health_check.sh\",\"exit_code\":0,\"status\":\"success\",\"summary\":\"All checks passed\",\"sanitized_output\":\"OK: disk 70% - [REDACTED]\"}\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n- Scheduler MUST NOT invoke OpenCode slash-commands or agents (per product decision).\n- Reuse `src/lib/redact.ts` for sanitization; add tests to extend patterns where needed.\n- Legacy code/tests/docs removal is destructive; perform only after verifying new implementation in CI and manual acceptance.\n\nNotes\nMarking epic in_progress to start implementation planning and work.\\n\\nCommands executed in this session:\\n- bd update wf-e6r --status in_progress --notes <this note>\\n- bd show wf-e6r --json (verify)\\n\\nFiles changed:\\n- .beads/issues.jsonl (updated status/notes)\\n\\nNext steps (recommendation):\\n- Assign owners for Implement tasks (e.g., wf-e6r.1.1, wf-e6r.2.1) and claim the appropriate child tasks before starting code.\\n- Prepare implementation branch for wf-e6r.1 (branch name: wf-e6r.1/<short-desc>) and wf-e6r.2 (wf-e6r.2/<short-desc>).\\n- If you want I can prepare the implementation branch plan (files to create + acceptance criteria) for wf-e6r.1 + wf-e6r.2.,","id":"wf-tmkd","issueType":"epic","parentId":null,"priority":"critical","stage":"","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Cron-style OODA Scheduler","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T08:33:06.952Z"},"type":"workitem"}

This leads to AI agents creating minimal issues without the structured documentation that templates provide. Adding template guidance would:\n\n1. Improve issue quality by encouraging use of structured templates\n2. Ensure bugs include reproduction steps and environment details\n3. Ensure features capture design decisions and alternatives considered\n4. Maintain consistency across issues created by different AI agents\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **AI Agent Onboarding**: When a new AI agent runs `bd onboard`, it learns to use templates for bugs, features, and epics automatically\n2. **Existing Projects**: Teams can regenerate AGENTS.md with updated best practices by re-running `bd onboard`\n3. **Documentation Consistency**: All projects using beads get consistent, high-quality issue documentation\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nModify the `bd onboard` command output in two places:\n\n1. **AGENTS.md content**: Update the \"Create new issues\" section to show template usage:\n   ```bash\n   # For bugs and features, use templates for structured documentation\n   bd create \"Bug title\" --from-template bug -p 1 --json\n   bd create \"Feature title\" --from-template feature -p 2 --json\n   ```\n\n2. **Add Templates section** after \"MCP Server\" section with:\n   - List of available templates (bug, feature, epic)\n   - When to use each template\n   - When to skip templates (tasks/chores)\n   - Template viewing commands\n\n3. **Update Important Rules** to include: \"Use templates (`--from-template`) for bugs, features, and epics\"\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n- **Alternative 1**: Add template suggestions to `bd create` command itself (e.g., prompt \"Use --from-template?\")\n  - Why not chosen: Too intrusive for human users who may prefer quick issue creation\n  \n- **Alternative 2**: Create separate `bd onboard --with-templates` flag\n  - Why not chosen: Splits the onboarding experience; templates should be default best practice\n\nNotes\nReference implementation: This project's AGENTS.md and .github/copilot-instructions.md files contain the exact changes needed.\n\nUpstream repo: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads\n\nNext steps:\n1. Fork the beads repository\n2. Locate the onboard command source (likely cmd/onboard.go)\n3. Apply the template guidance additions shown in this project\n4. Test with 'bd onboard' in a fresh directory\n5.

Producers want the command to surface the next most important work specifically for that Epic (child or blocking item) and to make the Epic context explicit in the recommendation.\n\nUsers\n\n- Primary: Producer / PM who uses `wf next` to decide what to direct agents or humans to work on next.\n- Secondary: Engineers/agents who pick the recommended bead to start work.\n\nSuccess criteria\n\n1. When the top-ranked issue (by existing selection logic) is an Epic and its status is in_progress, `wf next` should instead recommend the most important child or blocking issue for that Epic.\n2. \"Most important\" selection rule (v1): prefer any child that is already in_progress (recommend finishing it). If none are in_progress, pick the child or blocking issue with the highest bv priority score (fallback to numeric priority then recency if bv is unavailable).\n3. Output must clearly indicate: the parent Epic is in_progress, the recommended issue is selected as the next-most-important for that Epic, and whether the recommended issue is a child or a blocker. If a child/blocker is already in_progress, highlight that and state that completing it is the highest priority.\n4. `wf next [search]` and optional `--assignee <name>` behavior: `--assignee` should filter candidates by assignee before applying the Epic-focused selection; if no assignee provided, select across all assignees.\n5. Tests: add unit tests for the selection logic and an integration test that exercises bd show/list and verifies CLI output.  (User requested acceptance criteria: unit tests + idempotence)\n6. Idempotence: running the command repeatedly must not mutate bead state; any proposed annotations or comments must be idempotent (no duplicate comments on repeat runs). The default behavior is proposal-only (do not auto-update bd assignee or status).\n\nConstraints\n\n- Read-only by default: the command must not change bead status or assignee unless an explicit follow-up flag/action is added in a later change.\n- Deterministic tie-breakers: where scores tie, break deterministically by numeric priority then created_at then id.\n- Use existing signals where available: bv priority scores when available, fallback to local heuristics when not.\n- Keep CLI latency reasonable: scope search to Epic's children and direct blockers rather than entire issue set when Epic context applies.\n\nExisting state\n\n- Current implementation: src/commands/next.ts (implements ranking, fuzzy search, bv integration, --assignee filter, and JSON/human output)\n- Current PRD: docs/dev/prd-command-next.md (covers search-prioritized selection and general next behavior)\n- Tests area: tests/ (tests/next.test.ts exists as a starting point)\n- Beads issues referencing next, PRD, and PM skills (examples: wf-70j.*, wf-5e2, wf-c2n)\n\nDesired change\n\n- Update the existing PRD at docs/dev/prd-command-next.md to include a new section describing Epic-aware selection when the currently in-progress item is an Epic.\n- Implement the selection changes in src/commands/next.ts:\n  - Detect when the top candidate is an Epic with status `in_progress`.\n  - Gather that Epic's child issues and any immediate blocking issues.\n  - Apply selection rules: prefer in_progress children, else bv score (fallback to priority/recency).\n  - Maintain `--assignee` optional filter behavior: apply assignee filter before Epic-focused selection.\n  - Update human output: clearly show Epic context and why the child/blocker was chosen.\n- Add unit tests for the new selection logic and an integration test exercising bd outputs and CLI human output.\n- Ensure idempotence and proposal-only behavior (no automatic bd state mutation).\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs\n\n- docs/dev/prd-command-next.md — existing PRD to UPDATE\n- docs/Workflow.md — guidance on how Producers use `next` in practice\n- src/commands/next.ts — implementation to change\n- tests/next.test.ts — place to add tests\n\nRelated Beads issues\n\n- wf-70j.5 — PM skill: assignment proposal heuristics + propose-only confirmation\n- wf-70j.4 — PM skill: generate bead hierarchy (plan) with PRD traceability\n- wf-70j.2 — PM skill: scripted interview + intake normalization (reuse /intake)\n- wf-5e2 — PM: decompose PRD into bead plan (plan command)\n- wf-c2n — source issue referenced by existing PRD\n\nRecommended next step\n\n- UPDATE PRD at: docs/dev/prd-command-next.md (I will propose an updated PRD section to capture Epic-aware selection).\n\nAreas that could use further expansion\n\n- Exact formatting of the human output (example snippet) — I can draft a suggested output layout (one-row table + Details + an explicit \"Epic context: <epic-id> (in_progress) — recommended child: <id> (<reason>)\").\n- Whether a non-default mode should allow automatic assignment/claiming of the recommended child (out of scope for v1; requires explicit opt-in).\n\nOpen questions (answered)\n\n1. Fallback rule: bv → numeric priority → recency → id (confirmed: user accepted)\n2. Children vs blockers: treat equal (confirmed: user accepted)\n3.

We need a `waif ask` command that accepts a prompt, sends it to an agent (default `Map`/`PM`), allows optionally prefixing the prompt with an agent name (e.g. `ask patch ...`), and returns the agent's response to the console in Markdown (or `--json`) with no session tracking (one-shot MVP).\n\nUsers\n\nPrimary: producers who need fast, ad-hoc answers in the terminal (PMs/engineers writing prompts).\nSecondary: CLI users and automation that may call `waif ask` from scripts; QA and docs teams who rely on predictable one-shot outputs.\n\nSuccess criteria\n\nMVP success is that a user can run `waif ask \"<prompt>\"` and receive a coherent agent response rendered as Markdown to the console (or machine-readable JSON when `--json` is passed). The UX/implementation goal: ask -> get response (no session), responses are stable Markdown and usable in pipelines.\n\nConstraints\n\nNo timeline or special constraints were specified. No session tracking or state persistence in MVP. Default agent is `Map` (PM); agent override via prefixing the prompt is required. No privacy/security constraints specified by requester.\n\nExisting state\n\n- The CLI contains a PRD/CLI design effort (`docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md`) and PRD-agent wiring work (`wf-ba2.3.6`, `wf-ba2.3.1`) that overlap with PRD generation and OpenCode integration. There is not a dedicated `waif ask` command implemented today.\n\nDesired change\n\nAdd a new `waif ask` CLI command that:\n- Accepts a prompt string or reads from stdin\n- Sends the prompt to a chosen agent (default `Map`/`PM`), allowing an agent name prefix to override\n- Returns the agent's response to stdout rendered as Markdown, or `--json` for machine output\n- Is one-shot only (no session persistence)\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs\n\n- `docs/dev/CLI_PRD.md`\n- `docs/Workflow.md` (intake/PRD workflow)\n- `docs/dev/TUI_PRD.md`\n- `docs/dev/implemented/find_next_PRD.md`\n\nRelated issues\n\n- `wf-ba2.3.1` - Minimal PRD generator (writes Markdown file)\n- `wf-ba2.3.6` - Wire waif prd command to PRD Agent workflow\n- `wf-ba2.3` - PRD Template & Validation (epic)\n- `wf-7m7` - Add waif command to validate implementation plan integrity (related CLI expansion)\n- `wf-soh` - Integrate marked-terminal markdown rendering for all CLI output (rendering pipeline)\n\nClarifying questions\n\n1. Confirm default agent: should `Map` (PM) be the default for `waif ask`?  \n2. Which output modes are required beyond `--json` and rendered Markdown (e.g., raw text, exit codes for partial failures)?  \n3. Should `waif ask` support reading prompts from stdin or files for scripting?  \n4. Is any prompt auditing/logging required (even minimal), or must MVP avoid writing prompts anywhere?  \n5.

(Preferred: read existing `--external-ref` on the bead and/or search GitHub issues for a marker.)\n- How do we define and measure “Copilot successfully implements the feature in 95% of cases”? (e.g., merged PR without human code changes? closed issue without reopen? time-to-merge threshold?)\n\n## Recommended next step\nNEW PRD at: `docs/prd/delegate_beads_to_github_copilot_PRD.md`\n\n## Notes\n- The `--external-ref` flag accepts a freeform string; for this feature we store the full GitHub Issue URL.\n\n\n\n### Milestones: changelog\n- 2026-01-22T03:26:37.632066Z: Created/updated milestone epics:\n  - wf-aa67\n  - wf-cntz\n  - wf-nqlf\n  - wf-1zrt\n  - wf-82cl\n  - wf-h23x\n  - wf-tpee\n<!-- GENERATED MILESTONES START -->\n### Milestones (generated)\n\n1) Discovery & Eligibility — wf-aa67\n\n    ## Success Criteria\\n- Unit tests for eligibility; documented subtree algorithm; decision recorded on external_ref reuse.\\n\\nShort summary: Define eligibility, subtree traversal, and blocker policy.\n\n2) Issue Template & Synthesis — wf-cntz\n\n    ## Success Criteria\\n- Dry-run outputs match template; marker present; security review done.\\n\\nShort summary: Design the OpenCode-driven GitHub Issue template.\n\n3) GitHub Issue Creation — wf-z7kc\n\n    ## Success Criteria\\n- Creates a new GitHub Issue when no external_ref exists; issue assigned to 'copilot'; idempotent create path tested.\\n\\nShort summary: Implement GH Issue creation for delegation (no-search fallback).\n\n4) GitHub Issue Reuse & Search Fallback — wf-wz8v\n\n    ## Success Criteria\\n- Reuse existing GH Issue when external_ref present; otherwise search GitHub for marker beads-delegation:<bead-id> and reuse if found.\\n\\nShort summary: Implement reuse and optional search fallback for idempotence.\n\n5) GitHub Integration & Idempotence — wf-nqlf\n\n    ## Success Criteria\\n- Creates exactly one issue; re-run reuses issue; mocked tests in place.\\n\\nShort summary: Implement create/reuse of a single GitHub Issue.\n\n6) Beads Atomic Updates — wf-1zrt\n\n    ## Success Criteria\\n- All-or-none updates; idempotence assured; integration tests for failure cases.\\n\\nShort summary: Atomically update beads in scope with in_progress and external_ref.\n\n7) Tests & Automation — wf-82cl\n\n    ## Success Criteria\\n- Tests cover core flows; idempotence scenarios tested; dry-run equals apply in test harness.\\n\\nShort summary: Ship tests and harness for core flows.\n\n8) Docs & CLI UX — wf-h23x\n\n    ## Success Criteria\\n- CLI help updated; docs added; security notes included.\\n\\nShort summary: Finalize CLI flags, help, examples, and safety guidance.\n\n9) Beta E2E & Telemetry — wf-tpee\n\n    ## Success Criteria\\n- At least one successful manual e2e; e2e report produced; follow-ups recorded.\\n\\nShort summary: Run manual e2e delegations and collect feedback.\n\n<!-- GENERATED MILESTONES END -->\n\n\n### Milestones: changelog\n- 2026-01-22T03:34:43.668342Z: Adjusted milestone breakdown: inserted wf-z7kc and wf-wz8v, rewired deps.","id":"wf-vh3z","issueType":"feature","parentId":"wf-ty2z","priority":"high","stage":"","status":"in-progress","tags":[],"title":"Feature: Delegate stage:plan_defined beads to GitHub Copilot","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T08:33:07.004Z"},"type":"workitem"}

This is not useful for Producers: they usually want the next actionable child or immediate blocker to work on, not the Epic container.\n\nUsers\n\n- Primary: Product Manager (Producer) running `waif next` to decide next work.\n- Secondary: Agents and engineers who consume `waif next --json` for automation.\n\nSuccess criteria\n\n1. A failing test is added that reproduces the current bug (test-first).\n   - Suggested test file: `tests/next.epic-inprogress.test.ts` (test-first reproducer).\n2. Implementation updates `src/commands/next.ts` so that when a selected top candidate is an Epic in `in_progress` the command:\n   - recursively prefers in-progress child/blocker chains and descends until reaching leaf nodes, and\n   - among leaf candidates, selects the one with the highest BV score (or falls back to existing deterministic tie-breakers).\n3. All existing `tests/next*.ts` pass, new test passes, and overall test suite remains green.\n4. Deterministic results for identical inputs (stable tie-breaking rules).\n5. `waif next --json` preserves the current JSON contract; `waif` metadata remains present and includes epic_context when applicable.\n6. No regressions for `--assignee`, search, or non-epic flows.\n\nConstraints\n\n- Read-only: command must not change Beads state.\n- Deterministic tie-breaking (BV -> priority -> created_at -> id).\n- Performance: recursion limited to direct child/blocker chains (do not traverse whole graph broadly).\n- Preserve existing JSON output shape for automation consumers.\n\nExisting state\n\n- Primary code: `src/commands/next.ts` (current selection logic, epic-aware branch exists but sometimes returns the Epic itself).\n- Tests: `tests/next.test.ts` covers many `waif next` behaviors; add a new failing test first.\n- Documentation: `docs/dev/prd/prd-command-next.md` documents desired search and epic-aware semantics.\n\nDesired change\n\n- Update selection algorithm in `src/commands/next.ts`:\n  1. When top-ranked candidate is an Epic with status `in_progress`, enter Epic-aware mode.\n  2. For that Epic, build the directed set composed of its direct children (parent-child) and immediate blockers (blocks relations).\n  3. If any related issue is `in_progress`, prefer those and recursively descend along any `in_progress` child/blocker chain until you reach one or more leaf nodes (issues that have no `in_progress` related child/blocker).\n  4. When leaf candidates are reached, choose the leaf with the highest BV score. If BV unavailable, fall back to the existing numeric priority -> created_at -> id tie-break.\n  5. Maintain and emit `waif.epic_context` in JSON output with `{ epic_id, epic_status, selection_reason, recommended_id }` so automation can detect epic-scoped recommendations.\n  6. Add one or more unit/integration tests that first assert the failing behavior (test-first), then validate the fix.\n\nRelated code\n\n- Primary implementation: `src/commands/next.ts`\n- Tests to update/add: `tests/next.test.ts` and `tests/next.epic-inprogress.test.ts`\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs\n\n- `docs/dev/prd/prd-command-next.md` (existing PRD covering epic-aware selection and search behavior)\n- `docs/Workflow.md` (how `waif next` fits into Producer flow)\n\nRelated Beads issues\n\n- wf-uctv (epic-aware selection — related source)\n- wf-3ur.1 (Add `--number` option — blocker for multi-suggestion flows)\n- wf-dak (Agent-specific waif next — related behavior)\n\nRecommended next step\n\n- UPDATE PRD at: `docs/dev/prd/prd-command-next.md` (document the bug, the test-first plan, and the refined recursion rule).\n\nPlanned Beads issue (do not create until you approve):\n\n- Type: `bug`\n- Priority: `0` (critical) — per your preference\n- Title (working): `bug: waif next returns epic when epic is in_progress — descend to in-progress child/blocker leaf`\n- Assignee: `Build`\n- Labels: `state:idea`\n\nI will create this Beads issue when you approve the intake; the PRD will be updated in place first.\n\nNotes / open questions\n\n- Confirm desired beads issue type and priority. This is a bug fix but the repository PRD exists; recommended issue type: `feature` with `priority 1` so work can be scheduled—confirm if you prefer `bug` instead.\n- Clarify whether recursion should follow both `parent-child` and `blocks` directions symmetrically; current proposal treats both as candidate relations and recurses when `in_progress` children/blockers exist.\n\nRisks & assumptions (added)\n\n- BV scores may be absent; code will fall back to numeric priority -> created_at -> id as documented.\n- Deep or cyclic dependency graphs are possible; recursion will be limited to direct relations and must avoid infinite loops by tracking visited ids.\n- Tests will be added test-first to ensure regression safety.\n","id":"wf-wf-jgcz","issueType":"bug","parentId":null,"priority":"critical","stage":"","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"bug: waif next returns epic when epic is in_progress — descend to in-progress child/blocker leaf","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T08:32:13.876Z"},"type":"workitem"}

Producers want the command to surface the next most important work specifically for that Epic (child or blocking item) and to make the Epic context explicit in the recommendation.\n\nUsers\n\n- Primary: Producer / PM who uses `wf next` to decide what to direct agents or humans to work on next.\n- Secondary: Engineers/agents who pick the recommended bead to start work.\n\nSuccess criteria\n\n1. When the top-ranked issue (by existing selection logic) is an Epic and its status is in_progress, `wf next` should instead recommend the most important child or blocking issue for that Epic.\n2. \"Most important\" selection rule (v1): prefer any child that is already in_progress (recommend finishing it). If none are in_progress, pick the child or blocking issue with the highest bv priority score (fallback to numeric priority then recency if bv is unavailable).\n3. Output must clearly indicate: the parent Epic is in_progress, the recommended issue is selected as the next-most-important for that Epic, and whether the recommended issue is a child or a blocker. If a child/blocker is already in_progress, highlight that and state that completing it is the highest priority.\n4. `wf next [search]` and optional `--assignee <name>` behavior: `--assignee` should filter candidates by assignee before applying the Epic-focused selection; if no assignee provided, select across all assignees.\n5. Tests: add unit tests for the selection logic and an integration test that exercises bd show/list and verifies CLI output.  (User requested acceptance criteria: unit tests + idempotence)\n6. Idempotence: running the command repeatedly must not mutate bead state; any proposed annotations or comments must be idempotent (no duplicate comments on repeat runs). The default behavior is proposal-only (do not auto-update bd assignee or status).\n\nConstraints\n\n- Read-only by default: the command must not change bead status or assignee unless an explicit follow-up flag/action is added in a later change.\n- Deterministic tie-breakers: where scores tie, break deterministically by numeric priority then created_at then id.\n- Use existing signals where available: bv priority scores when available, fallback to local heuristics when not.\n- Keep CLI latency reasonable: scope search to Epic's children and direct blockers rather than entire issue set when Epic context applies.\n\nExisting state\n\n- Current implementation: src/commands/next.ts (implements ranking, fuzzy search, bv integration, --assignee filter, and JSON/human output)\n- Current PRD: docs/dev/prd-command-next.md (covers search-prioritized selection and general next behavior)\n- Tests area: tests/ (tests/next.test.ts exists as a starting point)\n- Beads issues referencing next, PRD, and PM skills (examples: wf-70j.*, wf-5e2, wf-c2n)\n\nDesired change\n\n- Update the existing PRD at docs/dev/prd-command-next.md to include a new section describing Epic-aware selection when the currently in-progress item is an Epic.\n- Implement the selection changes in src/commands/next.ts:\n  - Detect when the top candidate is an Epic with status `in_progress`.\n  - Gather that Epic's child issues and any immediate blocking issues.\n  - Apply selection rules: prefer in_progress children, else bv score (fallback to priority/recency).\n  - Maintain `--assignee` optional filter behavior: apply assignee filter before Epic-focused selection.\n  - Update human output: clearly show Epic context and why the child/blocker was chosen.\n- Add unit tests for the new selection logic and an integration test exercising bd outputs and CLI human output.\n- Ensure idempotence and proposal-only behavior (no automatic bd state mutation).\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs\n\n- docs/dev/prd-command-next.md — existing PRD to UPDATE\n- docs/Workflow.md — guidance on how Producers use `next` in practice\n- src/commands/next.ts — implementation to change\n- tests/next.test.ts — place to add tests\n\nRelated Beads issues\n\n- wf-70j.5 — PM skill: assignment proposal heuristics + propose-only confirmation\n- wf-70j.4 — PM skill: generate bead hierarchy (plan) with PRD traceability\n- wf-70j.2 — PM skill: scripted interview + intake normalization (reuse /intake)\n- wf-5e2 — PM: decompose PRD into bead plan (plan command)\n- wf-c2n — source issue referenced by existing PRD\n\nRecommended next step\n\n- UPDATE PRD at: docs/dev/prd-command-next.md (I will propose an updated PRD section to capture Epic-aware selection).\n\nAreas that could use further expansion\n\n- Exact formatting of the human output (example snippet) — I can draft a suggested output layout (one-row table + Details + an explicit \"Epic context: <epic-id> (in_progress) — recommended child: <id> (<reason>)\").\n- Whether a non-default mode should allow automatic assignment/claiming of the recommended child (out of scope for v1; requires explicit opt-in).\n\nOpen questions (answered)\n\n1.

(Manual interview continues inside the OpenCode session.)\n- The command must not create or modify beads automatically.\n\nConstraints\n- Must be a thin wrapper only: do not change `/intake` behavior, do not auto-create beads or PRDs, do not alter repo files.\n- Must respect existing `.opencode` configuration and environment variables (e.g., `OPENCODE_*`) so it does not break other OpenCode commands or workflows.\n- Must work on dev machines where `opencode` is available; if not present, print a clear error message with instructions.\n\nExisting state\n- `.opencode/command/intake.md` contains the OpenCode command template and interview questions.\n- `README.md` and `src/lib/opencode.ts` show existing OpenCode integration and CLI usage patterns.\n- There are multiple Beads issues concerning intake/PRD wiring (see Related issues below).\n\nDesired change\n- Add a `waif intake` CLI subcommand that:\n  - Ensures the local OpenCode environment is configured for this repo (uses `.opencode/` config),\n  - Starts an OpenCode session (interactive) and immediately sends `/intake` into it,\n  - Exits after launching the session (the interview runs interactively inside the session),\n  - Emits a helpful message/next-steps if `opencode` is not installed or fails to start.\n\nLikely duplicates / related docs (file paths)\n- `.opencode/command/intake.md`\n- `.opencode/command/prd.md`\n- `README.md`\n- `docs/Workflow.md`\n\nRelated issues (Beads ids)\n- wf-70j.2 — PM skill: scripted interview + intake normalization (reuse /intake)\n- wf-70j.1 — PM skill: define workflow composition with /intake and /prd\n- wf-v0m — Delegate command to pass work to another agent: Intake brief\n- wf-70j.6 — PM skill: command surface wiring (/intake, /prd, /assign-propose)\n- wf-32r — Beads search command: Intake brief\n- wf-3ur.2 — Add workflow stage tracking to WAIF CLI: Intake brief\n\nClarifying questions\n1. Parent bead selected: `wf-70j.2` (confirmed by requestor).\n2. No extra OpenCode args to auto-pass — default behavior only.\n3. Command will be interactive only and must not auto-create beads.\n\nProposed next step\n- Implementation: Add `waif intake` subcommand that starts an OpenCode session and issues `/intake`.\n- No standalone PRD required; attach this feature as a child of `wf-70j.2`.\n- Recommended follow-up: small CLI test that asserts `waif intake` exits with success when `opencode` present, and emits a user-facing error when not.","id":"wf-xsrr","issueType":"feature","parentId":"wf-f3f6","priority":"low","stage":"","status":"open","tags":[],"title":"waif intake command — convenience wrapper for /intake","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T08:33:07.505Z"},"type":"workitem"}

It must NOT copy `.beads/` (users should run `beads init` separately to create repository beads).\n\n## Constraints\n- Must NOT copy the repository’s `.beads/` folder.\n- Default behavior on conflicts: abort and explain how to use idempotent runs; do not overwrite silently.\n- Must not require elevated privileges or alter remote state; must be safe on repeated runs.\n- Must be compatible with existing `waif` CLI behavior and tests.\n\n## Existing state\n- `scripts/start-workflow-tmux.sh` (tmux startup script)\n- `config/workflow_agents.yaml` (tmux pane definitions)\n- `docs/dev/opencode_integration_PRD.md` (related setup PRD)\n- `docs/dev/context_pack_PRD.md` (related agent context PRD)\n- `docs/Workflow.md` (workflow guidance)\n\n## Desired change\nAdd a `waif init` CLI command that:\n- Runs `bd init --branch beads-wync --prefix <prefix>` in the target repo before copying files to create the beads sync worktree and avoid copying `.beads/`.\n- Copies the following template files into a target project: the entire `.opencode/` directory, `config/`, `scripts/`, and `docs/dev/`.\n- Do NOT copy `.beads/`.\n- Default conflict policy: abort with an explanation and guidance on idempotent re-runs.\n- Provide `--dry-run`, `--minimal` (only `config/`), and `--full` (config + scripts + `.opencode/` + `docs/dev/`) modes.\n- Optionally provide `--force-backup` for implementers to support backups (PRD will define exact flags).\n- Validate that `./scripts/start-workflow-tmux.sh` exists and is executable; output the command to start the workflow.\n\n## Likely duplicates / related docs\n- `docs/dev/opencode_integration_PRD.md`\n- `docs/dev/context_pack_PRD.md`\n- `docs/Workflow.md`\n- `config/workflow_agents.yaml`\n- `scripts/start-workflow-tmux.sh`\n- `config/waif_pacakges.yaml`\n\n## Related issues (Beads ids)\n- `wf-ba2.3.5` — Per-repo config file (template + lint rules)\n- `wf-jax`, `wf-jax.1` — Context/plugin PRD updates\n- `wf-moa` — Context pack default behavior\n- `wf-ba2.5.4.4` — Overflow handling for context pack\n\n## Clarifying questions\n1.

{"data":{"assignee":"","createdAt":"2025-12-24T23:32:38.599Z","createdBy":"","deleteReason":"","deletedBy":"","description":"Beads DB compaction\n\nSummary\n\nImplement a Beads (bd) feature that supports safe, configurable database compaction workflows based on the recommendations and example scripts from the upstream beads examples (https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/tree/main/examples/compaction). The feature should provide both interactive and fully-automated workflows, support tiered compaction levels, thresholds to avoid low-value runs, and clear observability (logs, stats, cost estimates).\n\nMotivation\n\nCompact sqlite-backed beads DBs periodically to reclaim space, reduce query costs/latency, and keep the JSONL/DB authoritative state tidy for long-running repositories. The upstream examples include workflow.sh (interactive), cron-compact.sh (cron automation) and auto-compact.sh (thresholded automation). Re-implement and integrate these recommendations into this project so teams can run safe compaction as part of maintenance, CI, or scheduled jobs.\n\nScope / Proposed features\n\n- Command surface: provide a 'bd compact' command (or extend existing compact support) with subcommands/modes:\n  - preview / dry-run: list candidate objects and show estimated reclaimable size and issue counts without changing DB\n  - run / execute: perform compaction, with tier option (tier 1 = safe/light, tier 2 = aggressive/deep)\n  - stats: print post-compact statistics and costs (issues compacted, bytes reclaimed, estimated $ cost)\n\n- Automation scripts: add example scripts (interactive workflow.sh, cron-compact.sh, auto-compact.sh) to examples/ or docs/ demonstrating safe usage patterns. These scripts should follow upstream recommendations:\n  - cron-compact: pulls latest changes, runs compact, logs output (BD_LOG_FILE), auto-commits and pushes when compact modifies repo (opt-in)\n  - auto-compact: thresholded runs (only compact when >= N eligible items), supports --tier and --dry-run\n  - workflow.sh: interactive confirmations and preview before committing\n\n- Configuration & env vars:\n  - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: only required if using any AI preview helpers from upstream examples (optional)\n  - BD_REPO_PATH: repo path for cron/script usage\n  - BD_LOG_FILE: where to write compaction logs\n  - CLI flags: --tier, --threshold, --dry-run, --yes/--confirm to bypass prompts, --log-file\n\n- Safety & defaults:\n  - Default to dry-run unless explicit --yes/--commit flag is provided\n  - Provide preview output and require explicit confirmation for any auto-commit/push\n  - Provide idempotent behavior and clear revert guidance in runbook\n\n- Tiering & thresholds:\n  - Tier 1: Quick compacting of easy candidates; low-risk, suitable for CI/auto mode\n  - Tier 2: Ultra-compression / deep compaction; higher risk/time, suitable for scheduled maintenance\n  - Thresholds to avoid noisy runs (e.g., only run if >= 50 eligible items by default)\n\n- Observability / cost monitoring:\n  - bd compact --stats to show counts, bytes reclaimed, and cost estimate\n  - Log file output and exit codes for CI/crontab\n\n- Testing & docs:\n  - Provide manual test instructions (how to run dry-run, how to run cron-compact.sh locally)\n  - Add runbook to history/ (or docs/ if intended to be permanent) with recommended schedules by project size (small/medium/large/high-velocity)\n\nOut of scope\n\n- Changes to underlying beads DB schema or the beads core sqlite engine other than invoking existing compact/rewrite mechanisms.\n\nReferences\n\n- Upstream examples: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/tree/main/examples/compaction\n\nRecommended owners\n\n- Owner (implementation): patch or a maintainer familiar with bd internals\n- Map (PM) to coordinate documentation, acceptance testing and rollout\n\n\n\nAcceptance Criteria\n1) Ability to run non-destructive dry-run compaction and produce a preview report. 2) Provide automated compacting scripts for cron/CI (tiered: tier1 quick, tier2 deep) with threshold configuration. 3) Safe default behavior: dry-run and require explicit opt-in for auto-commit/push. 4) Export compact stats via 'bd compact --stats' and log output to configurable file. 5) Docs and runbook added to docs/ or history/ with testing steps.

{"data":{"author":"muse","comment":"Title: WAIF — OpenCode Integration PRD\n\nOverview\nWAIF must provide a reproducible, testable integration with OpenCode so developers can install, register, and use an OpenCode runtime for local development and agent workflows. This PRD defines the waif setup flow, the package manifest location, hook lifecycle, CLI primitives (waif prime/opencode), acceptance criteria, security constraints, test plan, and rollout guidance.\n\nGoals / Success criteria\n- Developers can run a single command (waif setup opencode-hooks) that validates prerequisites, optionally installs required system packages (with confirmation), and registers WAIF plugin(s) with a local OpenCode server.\n- A waif prime/opencode command exists to inject compact priming context during lifecycle events (session.start, pre-compact).\n- Priming payloads are budgeted to ~1k–2k tokens by default; summarization/token utilities exist (summarize(text,targetTokens), countTokens(text)).\n- Installer exposes a health-check: emits a test OpenCode event and verifies OODA loop consumption.\n- Security: priming context never leaks secrets; a redaction utility and threat-model checklist exist before enabling any skills.\n- Full CI coverage: E2E tests run on Linux runners exercising installer, priming, event emission, and OODA detection.\n\nConstraints\n- Platform: Linux only (including WSL). No macOS-specific automation.\n- Package list: externalized in config/waif_pacakges.yaml (editable YAML).\n- Default: do NOT enable plugin-specific skills by default. Opt-in flag required to enable.\n- Installer policy: waif setup may attempt sudo apt installs after explicit user confirmation (Option B as requested).\n- Rollback policy: on partial failure waif setup will NOT attempt full automatic rollback; it will emit clear diagnostics and manual cleanup instructions (Option 2).\n\nNon-Goals\n- Do not ship a default enabled set of OpenCode skills. Skills are opt-in only.\n- Do not attempt to manage external CI runner credentials or cloud infra in the initial implementation.\n\nUser flows\n1) Developer installs prerequisites (manual or via waif setup):\n   - waif setup opencode-hooks\n     - Validate OpenCode server is reachable (local socket/HTTP) or provide instructions to start one\n     - Validate required system packages from config/waif_pacakges.yaml\n     - Prompt user to allow sudo installs (apt) when packages missing; on confirmation, run sudo apt install <packages>\n     - Register WAIF OpenCode plugin with the OpenCode runtime\n     - Run smoke health check: emit a test event and assert OODA notices it\n     - On success: print verification and uninstall instructions\n     - On failure: print diagnostics and manual cleanup steps\n\n2) Developer runs WAIF prime to inject compact context\n   - waif prime opencode --issue bd-123 --budget 1500\n     - Loads issue context (title, short description, latest comments) and runs summarize() to fit within token budget\n     - Calls OpenCode plugin registration endpoint to attach priming for session lifecycle events\n     - Optionally logs the generated priming payload to a local artifact for debugging (redacted)\n\n3) CI E2E job (Linux runner)\n   - Checkout fresh main\n   - Run waif setup opencode-hooks --noninteractive (CI mode) — CI will provide sudo if allowed by runner\n   - Run a small agent session that triggers session.start -> plugin emits event -> waif OODA pipeline detects and stores event\n   - Upload logs/artifacts for debugging\n\nHook lifecycle\n- session.start: emit compact context about active BD issue, assigned actor, and last 3 messages; used to seed agent session\n- pre-compact: run before compaction to provide summarization hooks; payloads should be restricted to non-sensitive metadata by default\n- Unregister: cleanup handler to remove the plugin registration from OpenCode\n\nSecurity & secrets handling\n- Primary rule: priming payloads MUST NOT contain raw secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys).\n- Provide a redaction utility (configurable patterns) that removes:\n  - strings that match common secret patterns (API keys, private keys)\n  - values in known secret paths (e.g., env var names in .env files)\n- Threat model checklist (deliverable): document where sensitive data can appear, who can access priming artifacts, and the approval process to enable skills.\n- Approval gate: enabling any skill that exposes broader context requires a security reviewer signoff (recorded in wf-gn7.2.7).\n\nTesting / CI\n- Unit tests: summarize() and countTokens() behaviors, redaction tests, CLI flag parsing\n- Integration tests: plugin registration, event emission, and OODA detection on a local OpenCode instance\n- E2E CI job: run on Linux runner; perform installer flow, run prime, assert event seen; artifact upload for logs\n- CI requirements: runner must be allowed to run sudo for apt installs in noninteractive mode (if chosen for CI). If not possible, CI should use a container image that already contains required system packages.\n\nInstaller policy & UX\n- Default behavior: detect missing system packages from config/waif_pacakges.yaml and present a prompt to the user:\n  - \"The following packages are required: <list>.

{"data":{"author":"muse","comment":"Title: WAIF — OpenCode Integration PRD\n\nOverview\nWAIF must provide a reproducible, testable integration with OpenCode so developers can install, register, and use an OpenCode runtime for local development and agent workflows. This PRD defines the waif setup flow, the package manifest location, hook lifecycle, CLI primitives (waif prime/opencode), acceptance criteria, security constraints, test plan, and rollout guidance.\n\nGoals / Success criteria\n- Developers can run a single command (waif setup opencode-hooks) that validates prerequisites, optionally installs required system packages (with confirmation), and registers WAIF plugin(s) with a local OpenCode server.\n- A waif prime/opencode command exists to inject compact priming context during lifecycle events (session.start, pre-compact).\n- Priming payloads are budgeted to ~1k–2k tokens by default; summarization/token utilities exist (summarize(text,targetTokens), countTokens(text)).\n- Installer exposes a health-check: emits a test OpenCode event and verifies OODA loop consumption.\n- Security: priming context never leaks secrets; a redaction utility and threat-model checklist exist before enabling any skills.\n- Full CI coverage: E2E tests run on Linux runners exercising installer, priming, event emission, and OODA detection.\n\nConstraints\n- Platform: Linux only (including WSL). No macOS-specific automation.\n- Package list: externalized in config/waif_pacakges.yaml (editable YAML).\n- Default: do NOT enable plugin-specific skills by default. Opt-in flag required to enable.\n- Installer policy: waif setup may attempt sudo apt installs after explicit user confirmation (Option B as requested).\n- Rollback policy: on partial failure waif setup will NOT attempt full automatic rollback; it will emit clear diagnostics and manual cleanup instructions (Option 2).\n\nNon-Goals\n- Do not ship a default enabled set of OpenCode skills. Skills are opt-in only.\n- Do not attempt to manage external CI runner credentials or cloud infra in the initial implementation.\n\nUser flows\n1) Developer installs prerequisites (manual or via waif setup):\n   - waif setup opencode-hooks\n     - Validate OpenCode server is reachable (local socket/HTTP) or provide instructions to start one\n     - Validate required system packages from config/waif_pacakges.yaml\n     - Prompt user to allow sudo installs (apt) when packages missing; on confirmation, run sudo apt install <packages>\n     - Register WAIF OpenCode plugin with the OpenCode runtime\n     - Run smoke health check: emit a test event and assert OODA notices it\n     - On success: print verification and uninstall instructions\n     - On failure: print diagnostics and manual cleanup steps\n\n2) Developer runs WAIF prime to inject compact context\n   - waif prime opencode --issue bd-123 --budget 1500\n     - Loads issue context (title, short description, latest comments) and runs summarize() to fit within token budget\n     - Calls OpenCode plugin registration endpoint to attach priming for session lifecycle events\n     - Optionally logs the generated priming payload to a local artifact for debugging (redacted)\n\n3) CI E2E job (Linux runner)\n   - Checkout fresh main\n   - Run waif setup opencode-hooks --noninteractive (CI mode) — CI will provide sudo if allowed by runner\n   - Run a small agent session that triggers session.start -> plugin emits event -> waif OODA pipeline detects and stores event\n   - Upload logs/artifacts for debugging\n\nHook lifecycle\n- session.start: emit compact context about active BD issue, assigned actor, and last 3 messages; used to seed agent session\n- pre-compact: run before compaction to provide summarization hooks; payloads should be restricted to non-sensitive metadata by default\n- Unregister: cleanup handler to remove the plugin registration from OpenCode\n\nSecurity & secrets handling\n- Primary rule: priming payloads MUST NOT contain raw secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys).\n- Provide a redaction utility (configurable patterns) that removes:\n  - strings that match common secret patterns (API keys, private keys)\n  - values in known secret paths (e.g., env var names in .env files)\n- Threat model checklist (deliverable): document where sensitive data can appear, who can access priming artifacts, and the approval process to enable skills.\n- Approval gate: enabling any skill that exposes broader context requires a security reviewer signoff (recorded in wf-gn7.2.7).\n\nTesting / CI\n- Unit tests: summarize() and countTokens() behaviors, redaction tests, CLI flag parsing\n- Integration tests: plugin registration, event emission, and OODA detection on a local OpenCode instance\n- E2E CI job: run on Linux runner; perform installer flow, run prime, assert event seen; artifact upload for logs\n- CI requirements: runner must be allowed to run sudo for apt installs in noninteractive mode (if chosen for CI). If not possible, CI should use a container image that already contains required system packages.\n\nInstaller policy & UX\n- Default behavior: detect missing system packages from config/waif_pacakges.yaml and present a prompt to the user:\n  - \"The following packages are required: <list>. Allow waif to run sudo apt install? [y/N]\"\n  - If user consents, run apt install; otherwise, print step-by-step instructions and exit with a non-zero status\n- Provide --yes/--noninteractive flags for scripted installs (CI) but require the runner to provide appropriate privileges\n- On failure, provide a clear diagnostics bundle and manual cleanup instructions (no automatic rollback)\n\nDeliverables / timeline (suggested)\n- M1 (1–2 days): Draft PRD (this document) and package YAML stub at config/waif_pacakges.yaml; create skeleton CLI commands: src/commands/prime_opencode.ts; src/lib/hooks/opencode.ts; basic tests stubs\n- M2 (3–5 days): Implement waif prime/opencode CLI and priming utils (summarize, countTokens) with unit tests\n- M3 (3–5 days): Implement waif setup opencode-hooks installer (with sudo flow) and smoke health-check; document manual cleanup steps\n- M4 (2–4 days): CI E2E tests and artifact upload; security review and redaction utility; opt-in skills gating\n\nFiles to add / edit\n- docs/dev/opencode_integration_PRD.md  (this file)\n- config/waif_pacakges.yaml  (package manifest stub)\n- src/commands/prime_opencode.ts  (CLI skeleton)\n- src/lib/hooks/opencode.ts  (hook registration + emitter)\n- src/lib/priming/summarize.ts  (summarize & token counting)\n- tests/unit/priming.test.ts\n- tests/e2e/opencode_hooks.test.ts\n- history/wf-gn7.*.md (spike artifacts and threat model)\n\nOwners (tentative, assigned by agents)\n- wf-gn7.2.1 (CLI hooks): patch\n- wf-gn7.2.2 (installer + health checks): ship\n- wf-gn7.2.3 (priming utils): patch\n- wf-gn7.2.4 (opt-in skills): scribbler\n- wf-gn7.2.5 (MCP fallback): ship\n- wf-gn7.2.6 (CI E2E): ship\n- wf-gn7.2.7 (security & redaction): probe\n\nOutstanding decisions & notes\n- No provider seeding required per request (opencode will handle provider configuration interactively)\n- Package YAML filename uses the provided: config/waif_pacakges.yaml\n- Installer will attempt sudo apt installs with explicit consent (Option B)\n- Rollback is manual (Option 2)\n\nAcceptance criteria (concise)\n- waif setup opencode-hooks runs on a Linux dev machine, validates prerequisites, registers WAIF plugin, and passes the smoke health-check\n- waif prime opencode registers priming hooks and emits priming payloads on session.start and pre-compact\n- Priming payloads are constrained to configured token budgets and pass redaction checks\n- CI E2E job executes on Linux and produces logs/artifacts demonstrating successful event flow\n\nNext actions (I will perform if you confirm)\n1) Create initial stub files for config/waif_pacakges.yaml and docs/dev/opencode_integration_PRD.md (Done)\n2) Create CLI skeletons and test stubs (src/commands/prime_opencode.ts, src/lib/hooks/opencode.ts, src/lib/priming/*)\n3) Post a bd comment linking the PRD and listing created files\n4) Assign owners to child bd issues (done per tentative mapping)\n\n","createdAt":"2025-12-25T04:11:22.000Z","id":"wf-7upa-C202","references":[],"workItemId":"wf-7upa"},"type":"comment"}

{"data":{"author":"rgardler","comment":"/delegate @ship\n\nDo this now (authoritative handoff)\n\nRationale\n- We need GitHub Copilot to post an automated review only when a PR is first opened, and NOT to create new automated reviews on subsequent PR updates. This reduces noise while preserving a first-pass automated review.\n\nScope (pick ONE approach and implement):\nA) Preferred — GitHub App configuration\n   - If the Copilot-for-PRs GitHub App is installable/configurable for this repo, update its settings so it runs on pull_request:opened only (or equivalent \"Run on PR open\" toggle) and does not run on pull_request:synchronize. Document the exact setting changed and provide evidence (screenshot link or setting dump) in the bd comment.\nB) Fallback — GitHub Actions workflow\n   - Add a minimal workflow at .github/workflows/copilot-pr-review.yml that triggers only on pull_request: types: [opened] and invokes the Copilot review action/API with least-privilege credentials. Document secrets used and their minimal scopes.\n\nAcceptance criteria (must meet to close wf-8re)\n1) On PR open, Copilot posts an automated review/comment within 10 minutes summarizing quick findings.\n2) On subsequent pushes to the same PR (pull_request:synchronize), no new automated Copilot review/comment is created. (Updating an existing comment is acceptable if documented, but do NOT create a new review on synchronize.)\n3) Demonstration: Create test PRs to show behaviour: ci/copilot-pr-check (open → Copilot review posted) and ci/copilot-pr-check-updated (push new commit → no new review). Provide PR URLs and timestamps.\n4) Documentation: add history/github-copilot-pr.md describing chosen approach, commands run, permissions/secrets used, how to revert, and test evidence.\n5) Post a bd comment on wf-8re with exact git/gh commands run, PR URLs, and verification evidence. If org-admin action was required, include the escalation details.\n\nConstraints & notes\n- Do NOT base branches on local uncommitted changes. Always create branches from origin/main.\n- Prefer the App route for least privilege. If App change requires org-admin, escalate immediately and document the requested admin action.\n- If using Actions, use a machine user token with minimal repo scope and document rotation/expiry recommendation.\n\nImmediate steps (exact commands to run now)\n1) Check App availability:\n   - git fetch origin\n   - gh api repos/:owner/:repo/installation --jq '.id' || echo \"No App installation info available\"\n   - If App present, inspect its settings in the GitHub UI and change to run on PR opened only (document the UI path and exact toggles changed).\n2) If App route unavailable, implement workflow:\n   - git fetch origin && git checkout -b copilot-pr/setup origin/main\n   - Create .github/workflows/copilot-pr-review.yml with 'on: pull_request: types: [opened]'\n   - git add .github/workflows/copilot-pr-review.yml && git commit -m \"wf-8re: add Copilot PR-on-open workflow\" && git push -u origin copilot-pr/setup\n   - gh pr create --title \"ci: copilot-pr-check\" --head copilot-pr/setup --base main --body \"Test: Copilot PR-on-open behaviour. References bd#wf-8re\"\n3) Create a short test PR branch to demonstrate behaviour:\n   - git checkout -b ci/copilot-pr-check origin/main && gh pr create --title \"test: copilot pr check\" --head ci/copilot-pr-check --base main\n\nReporting & handoff\n- Post an acknowledgement comment on bd#wf-8re with the exact commands you ran and their outputs (copy-paste). Include PR URLs and evidence (timestamps, screenshots or links) showing Copilot ran on open and not on synchronize.\n- If you need org-admin permissions to change App settings, post a blocker comment on wf-8re and escalate to the Producer with the exact admin steps required.\n\nTimebox\n- Priority: P2. Target initial implementation + demo within 2 working days. Escalate immediately if admin privileges are required.\n\nFiles expected to be created/edited if using Actions route:\n- .github/workflows/copilot-pr-review.yml\n- history/github-copilot-pr.md\n- Branches: copilot-pr/setup and ci/copilot-pr-check\n\nPlease acknowledge pickup on bd#wf-8re and post the first commands you run. Then proceed to implement the chosen approach and post PR/verification links.\n\nNOTE: Do not run these steps on the main working tree if there are local uncommitted changes; create a fresh branch from origin/main or use a worktree/clone instead.\n","createdAt":"2026-01-14T05:06:54.000Z","id":"wf-8re-C165","references":[],"workItemId":"wf-8re"},"type":"comment"}

{"data":{"author":"muse","comment":"Title: WAIF — OpenCode Integration PRD\n\nOverview\nWAIF must provide a reproducible, testable integration with OpenCode so developers can install, register, and use an OpenCode runtime for local development and agent workflows. This PRD defines the waif setup flow, the package manifest location, hook lifecycle, CLI primitives (waif prime/opencode), acceptance criteria, security constraints, test plan, and rollout guidance.\n\nGoals / Success criteria\n- Developers can run a single command (waif setup opencode-hooks) that validates prerequisites, optionally installs required system packages (with confirmation), and registers WAIF plugin(s) with a local OpenCode server.\n- A waif prime/opencode command exists to inject compact priming context during lifecycle events (session.start, pre-compact).\n- Priming payloads are budgeted to ~1k–2k tokens by default; summarization/token utilities exist (summarize(text,targetTokens), countTokens(text)).\n- Installer exposes a health-check: emits a test OpenCode event and verifies OODA loop consumption.\n- Security: priming context never leaks secrets; a redaction utility and threat-model checklist exist before enabling any skills.\n- Full CI coverage: E2E tests run on Linux runners exercising installer, priming, event emission, and OODA detection.\n\nConstraints\n- Platform: Linux only (including WSL). No macOS-specific automation.\n- Package list: externalized in config/waif_pacakges.yaml (editable YAML).\n- Default: do NOT enable plugin-specific skills by default. Opt-in flag required to enable.\n- Installer policy: waif setup may attempt sudo apt installs after explicit user confirmation (Option B as requested).\n- Rollback policy: on partial failure waif setup will NOT attempt full automatic rollback; it will emit clear diagnostics and manual cleanup instructions (Option 2).\n\nNon-Goals\n- Do not ship a default enabled set of OpenCode skills. Skills are opt-in only.\n- Do not attempt to manage external CI runner credentials or cloud infra in the initial implementation.\n\nUser flows\n1) Developer installs prerequisites (manual or via waif setup):\n   - waif setup opencode-hooks\n     - Validate OpenCode server is reachable (local socket/HTTP) or provide instructions to start one\n     - Validate required system packages from config/waif_pacakges.yaml\n     - Prompt user to allow sudo installs (apt) when packages missing; on confirmation, run sudo apt install <packages>\n     - Register WAIF OpenCode plugin with the OpenCode runtime\n     - Run smoke health check: emit a test event and assert OODA notices it\n     - On success: print verification and uninstall instructions\n     - On failure: print diagnostics and manual cleanup steps\n\n2) Developer runs WAIF prime to inject compact context\n   - waif prime opencode --issue bd-123 --budget 1500\n     - Loads issue context (title, short description, latest comments) and runs summarize() to fit within token budget\n     - Calls OpenCode plugin registration endpoint to attach priming for session lifecycle events\n     - Optionally logs the generated priming payload to a local artifact for debugging (redacted)\n\n3) CI E2E job (Linux runner)\n   - Checkout fresh main\n   - Run waif setup opencode-hooks --noninteractive (CI mode) — CI will provide sudo if allowed by runner\n   - Run a small agent session that triggers session.start -> plugin emits event -> waif OODA pipeline detects and stores event\n   - Upload logs/artifacts for debugging\n\nHook lifecycle\n- session.start: emit compact context about active BD issue, assigned actor, and last 3 messages; used to seed agent session\n- pre-compact: run before compaction to provide summarization hooks; payloads should be restricted to non-sensitive metadata by default\n- Unregister: cleanup handler to remove the plugin registration from OpenCode\n\nSecurity & secrets handling\n- Primary rule: priming payloads MUST NOT contain raw secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys).\n- Provide a redaction utility (configurable patterns) that removes:\n  - strings that match common secret patterns (API keys, private keys)\n  - values in known secret paths (e.g., env var names in .env files)\n- Threat model checklist (deliverable): document where sensitive data can appear, who can access priming artifacts, and the approval process to enable skills.\n- Approval gate: enabling any skill that exposes broader context requires a security reviewer signoff (recorded in wf-gn7.2.7).\n\nTesting / CI\n- Unit tests: summarize() and countTokens() behaviors, redaction tests, CLI flag parsing\n- Integration tests: plugin registration, event emission, and OODA detection on a local OpenCode instance\n- E2E CI job: run on Linux runner; perform installer flow, run prime, assert event seen; artifact upload for logs\n- CI requirements: runner must be allowed to run sudo for apt installs in noninteractive mode (if chosen for CI). If not possible, CI should use a container image that already contains required system packages.\n\nInstaller policy & UX\n- Default behavior: detect missing system packages from config/waif_pacakges.yaml and present a prompt to the user:\n  - \"The following packages are required: <list>. Allow waif to run sudo apt install? [y/N]\"\n  - If user consents, run apt install; otherwise, print step-by-step instructions and exit with a non-zero status\n- Provide --yes/--noninteractive flags for scripted installs (CI) but require the runner to provide appropriate privileges\n- On failure, provide a clear diagnostics bundle and manual cleanup instructions (no automatic rollback)\n\nDeliverables / timeline (suggested)\n- M1 (1–2 days): Draft PRD (this document) and package YAML stub at config/waif_pacakges.yaml; create skeleton CLI commands: src/commands/prime_opencode.ts; src/lib/hooks/opencode.ts; basic tests stubs\n- M2 (3–5 days): Implement waif prime/opencode CLI and priming utils (summarize, countTokens) with unit tests\n- M3 (3–5 days): Implement waif setup opencode-hooks installer (with sudo flow) and smoke health-check; document manual cleanup steps\n- M4 (2–4 days): CI E2E tests and artifact upload; security review and redaction utility; opt-in skills gating\n\nFiles to add / edit\n- docs/dev/opencode_integration_PRD.md  (this file)\n- config/waif_pacakges.yaml  (package manifest stub)\n- src/commands/prime_opencode.ts  (CLI skeleton)\n- src/lib/hooks/opencode.ts  (hook registration + emitter)\n- src/lib/priming/summarize.ts  (summarize & token counting)\n- tests/unit/priming.test.ts\n- tests/e2e/opencode_hooks.test.ts\n- history/wf-gn7.*.md (spike artifacts and threat model)\n\nOwners (tentative, assigned by agents)\n- wf-gn7.2.1 (CLI hooks): patch\n- wf-gn7.2.2 (installer + health checks): ship\n- wf-gn7.2.3 (priming utils): patch\n- wf-gn7.2.4 (opt-in skills): scribbler\n- wf-gn7.2.5 (MCP fallback): ship\n- wf-gn7.2.6 (CI E2E): ship\n- wf-gn7.2.7 (security & redaction): probe\n\nOutstanding decisions & notes\n- No provider seeding required per request (opencode will handle provider configuration interactively)\n- Package YAML filename uses the provided: config/waif_pacakges.yaml\n- Installer will attempt sudo apt installs with explicit consent (Option B)\n- Rollback is manual (Option 2)\n\nAcceptance criteria (concise)\n- waif setup opencode-hooks runs on a Linux dev machine, validates prerequisites, registers WAIF plugin, and passes the smoke health-check\n- waif prime opencode registers priming hooks and emits priming payloads on session.start and pre-compact\n- Priming payloads are constrained to configured token budgets and pass redaction checks\n- CI E2E job executes on Linux and produces logs/artifacts demonstrating successful event flow\n\nNext actions (I will perform if you confirm)\n1) Create initial stub files for config/waif_pacakges.yaml and docs/dev/opencode_integration_PRD.md (Done)\n2) Create CLI skeletons and test stubs (src/commands/prime_opencode.ts, src/lib/hooks/opencode.ts, src/lib/priming/*)\n3) Post a bd comment linking the PRD and listing created files\n4) Assign owners to child bd issues (done per tentative mapping)\n\n","createdAt":"2025-12-25T04:11:22.000Z","id":"wf-gn7-C34","references":[],"workItemId":"wf-gn7"},"type":"comment"}

Recommended next steps: 1) Create PRD at docs/dev/waif_opencode_plugin_PRD.md and link it to wf-gn7.1; 2) Run prototype spike wf-gn7.1.1 (1–2 day timebox) to validate context injection; 3) After spike, create implementation issues: plugin skeleton (register/subscribe/emit), developer docs, acceptance E2E test; 4) Assign owners and timeboxes for implementation and security review. Remaining risks: priming context leakage (redaction required), installer/CI constraints, and safety of autonomous task-agent features.
