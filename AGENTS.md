## work-item Tracking with Worklog (wl)

IMPORTANT: This project uses Worklog (wl) for ALL work-item tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

## CRITICAL RULES

- Use Worklog (wl), described below, for ALL task tracking, do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods
- When mentioning a work item always use its title followed by its ID in parentheses, e.g. "Fix login bug (WL-1234)"
- Always keep work items up to date with accurate status, priority, stage, and assignee
- Whenever you are provided with, or discover, a new work item create it in wl immediately
- Whenever you are provided with or discover important context (specifications, designs, user-stories) ensure the information is added to the description of the relevant work item(s) OR create a new work item if none exist
- Whenever you create a planning document (PRD, spec, design doc) add references to the document in the description of any work item that is directly related to the document
- Work items cannot be closed until all child items are closed, all blocking dependencies resolved and a Producer has reviewed and approved the work
- Never commit changes without associating them with a work item
- Never commit changes without ensuring all tests and quality checks pass
- Whenever a commit is made add a comment to impacted the work item(s) describing the changes, the files affected, and including the commit hash.
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
- When using backticks in arguments to shell commands, escape them properly to avoid errors

### Important Rules

- Use wl as a primary source of truth, only the source code is more authoritative
- Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- When new work items are discovered or prompted while working on an existing item create a new work item with `wl create`
  - If the item must be completed before the current work item can be completed add it as a child of the current item (`wl create --parent <current-work-item-id>`)
  - If the item is related to the current work item but not blocking its completion add a reference to the current item in the description (`discovered-from:<current-work-item-id>`)
- Check `wl next` before asking "what should I work on?" and always offer the response as a next steps suggestion, with an explanation
- Run `wl --help` and `wl <cmd> --help` to learn about the capabilities of WorkLog (wl) and discover available flags
- Use work items to track all significant work, including bugs, features, tasks, epics, chores
- Use clear, concise titles and detailed descriptions for all work items
- Use parent/child relationships to track dependencies and subtasks
- Use priorities to indicate the importance of work items
- Use stages to track workflow progress
- Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents

### work-item Types

Track work-item types with `--issue-type`:

- bug - Something broken
- feature - New functionality
- task - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- epic - Large feature with subtasks
- chore - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Work Item Descriptions

- Use clear, concise titles summarizing the work item.
- Do not escape special characters
- The description must provide sufficient context for understanding and implementing the work item.
- At a minimum include:
  - A summary of the problem or feature.
  - Example User Stories if applicable.
  - Expected behaviour and outcomes.
  - Steps to reproduce (for bugs).
  - Suggested implementation approach if relevant.
  - Links to related work items or documentation.
  - Measurable and testable acceptance criteria.

### Priorities

Worklog uses named priorities:

- critical - Security, data loss, broken builds
- high - Major features, important bugs
- medium - Default, nice-to-have
- low - Polish, optimization

### Dependencies

Use parent/child relationships to track blocking dependencies.

- Child items must be completed before the parent can be closed.
- If a work item blocks another, make it a child of the blocked item.
- If a work item blocks multiple items, create the parent/child relationships with the highest priority item as the parent unless one of the items is in-progress, in which case that item should be the parent.
  - If in doubt raise for product manager review.

Other types of dependencies can be tracked in descriptions, for example `discovered-from:<work-item-id>`, `related-to:<work-item-id>`, `blocked-by:<work-item-id>`.

Worklog does not enforce these relationships but they can be used for planning and tracking.

### Workflow management

- Use the `--stage` flag to track workflow stages according to your particular process,
  - e.g. `idea`, `prd_complete`, `milestones_defined`, `plan_complete`, `in_progress``done`.
- Use the `--assignee` flag to assign work items to agents.
- Use the `--tags` flag to add arbitrary tags for filtering and organization. Though avoid over-tagging.
- Use comments to document progress, decisions, and context.
- Use `risk` and `effort` fields to track complexity and potential issues.
  - If available use the `effort_and_risk` agent skill to estimate these values.

1. Check ready work: `wl next`
2. Claim your task: `wl update <id> --status in-progress`
3. Work on it: implement, test, document
4. Discover new work? Create a linked issue:

- `wl create "Found bug" --priority high --tags "discovered-from:<parent-id>"`

5. Complete: `wl close <id> --reason "PR #123 merged"`
6. Sync: run `wl sync` before ending the session
